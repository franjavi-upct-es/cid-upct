    "# Python multiprocessing module\n",
    "\n",
    "The `multiprocessing` module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) is a powerful and versatile library included in Python's standard distribution, designed to facilitate concurrent execution by spawning multiple processes. It provides a high-level interface for creating and managing processes, as well as a wide array of low-level tools to build complex systems for inter-process communication and synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike threads, which operate within the same memory space and are subject to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), `multiprocessing` spawns separate processes with individual memory spaces. This allows true parallelism on multi-core processors. The ideal case would be running one process per physical processor. In this case, each process would really be executed in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module includes tools for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating and managing processes.\n",
    "- Sharing data between processes using shared memory or managed objects.\n",
    "- Establishing communication channels like Pipes and Queues.\n",
    "- Synchronizing operations with primitives such as Locks, Events, Semaphores, and Conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library provides both low-level primitives for advanced users and high-level abstractions for easier use. The `Process` class is the main low level interface for creating processes. Higher-level constructs like `Pools` allow for an easy management of groups of worker processes, without the caveats of managing low-level interprocess communication and syncronization tasks.\n",

    "The Master process submit tasks to the workers, the workers perform the tasks, and finally the master retrieves results from the workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most used methods in the ``Pool`` Class are (although there are much more):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Synchronous (blocking) execution: the processes are completed in the same order in which they were started. This is achieved by locking the main program until the respective processes are finished.\n",
    "  - ``Pool.map()`` and ``Pool.starmap()``\n",
    "  - ``Pool.apply()``\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Asynchronous (non-blocking) execution: doesn’t involve locking. As a result, the order of results can get mixed up but usually gets work done quicker.\n",
    "  - ``Pool.map_async()`` and ``Pool.starmap_async()``\n",
    "  - ``Pool.apply_async()``\n",
    "\n",
    "The `map` method is only applicable to a function that accepts a single argument. For routines that accept multiple arguments, the `starmap` method must be used instead. Both versions take an iterable and chunk it into tasks, where every task has the same (mapped) target function.\n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to `apply` and `apply_async`, both take an `args` argument that accepts the parameters passed to the ‘function-to-be-parallelized’ as an argument, unlike `map` and similar to `starmap`. However, in this case, `apply` just makes a single call to the function to be parallelized. What does this mean? To really parallelize the funcion **you have to manually iterate the call to `apply` to make use of the pool of workers**. This has the advantage that in each call **you can specify not just a new chunk of data, but also a different task (function) to be executed in that worker**. That is, you can pass a task list and a data list with the arguments for each task.\n",

    "https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.apply_async\n",

    "In compute-intensive tasks, typically the problem is to apply the same function to a huge bunch of data, hence, we will give more attention here to `map` and derived methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other methods in the multiprocessing library permit the creation of pipes, queues and other approaches, but **the pool of (parallel) workers is by far the most typical and straitghforward approach to parallelize between the cores of a single computer**.\n",

    "- **It does not block the main program**:\n",
