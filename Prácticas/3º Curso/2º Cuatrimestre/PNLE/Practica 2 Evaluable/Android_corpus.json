However, once the user enters their PIN, pattern, or password for the first time, the device transitions to the After First Unlock (AFU) state, fully decrypting the userdata partition. Because this decrypted data can be valuable to hackers or government agencies, they often try to obtain already unlocked devices to perform digital forensics. The auto-reboot feature aims to combat this by forcing devices back into the BFU state if they remain locked for 3 consecutive days—an indicator the device might be held for such purposes.\n\nI thought that the data reverted back to the BFU state when the biometrics expire 24hours after first use?",

Without gapps, sure, and also for custom ROMs google can't have any control I dont think. But there should at least be some embedded like option for android, for low end devices. No fancy google apps, just straight simple functionality for whatever purpose, whether thats basic call and text for super budget phones, or emergency critical features for actual embedded systems.

Android is very customizable, so you aren't really forced to use Google software. There are however places where Google is nonnegotiable. The usage of Android without Google could be split in to couple of levels.\n\nLevel 1 would be just replacing Google apps and services whenever possible. That means 3rd party phone, SMS and contacts app, browser, email client, back up, cloud storage, everything imaginable. \n\nThere are however two things that cannot be replaced - Play Store and Wallet. You can technically pay with your phone using Samsung Pay, but that's only an option with Samsung, obviously. All other phones will use Google Wallet and it cannot be replaced with anything else. Play Store can be replaced with 3rd party app stores or you can side load apps manually. All of these options comes with clear disadvantages, like less user friendliness or smaller app catalogs. Meaning you have options, but nothing that would be as good as Play Store.\n\nLevel 2 would be getting a custom ROM stripped off Google Services completely. Like the many times mentioned Graphene OS.\n\nThe choice comes down to why and how you hate Google. If you just dislike using its software, option 1 is for you. If your main concern is Google not having your data, option 2 is the only way to go.",

You should also know that most Android OEMs (aside from Google) allow your carrier to install lots of bloatware that can be tricky to remove if you buy the device from the carrier. I recently got a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6, and T-Mobile was doing shit like installing Raid Shadow Legends without my permission. So, you'll likely want to buy an unlocked phone straight from the manufacturer, meaning you'll miss out on carrier promotions and discounts that you'd get with an iPhone or a Pixel (though most manufacturers have a trade in deal, if you're willing to hand over your current device). \n\nI'd caution you against making the jump out of frustration if you hate Google even more. Depending on your financial situation, I'd suggest the following:\n\n1. If you have the money to spare, add a line to your phone plan and get an Android device for that line, so you can try it out without totally abandoning your iPhone. Check your carrier's policies, but you'll likely have some kind of return window where you can give the device back and get a refund if you don't like it. If you do like it, you can swap the SIMs to keep your number on the new phone, then close the other line (and trade in or sell your iPhone). Note that you're unlikely to get a refund on the tax you pay for the phone, and may have to pay a restocking fee. Again: check your carrier's policy (and the manufacturer's policy if you buy the device from them), and give their customer support lines a call to make sure you understand how it works. \n\n2. If you can't afford to do that, you'll want to get VERY familiar with those return policies, and just take the plunge and try it out. Set a reminder for 7 days before the return window closes, so that you can be sure you can return it if you don't like it. \n\nIn either case, I'd also suggest going to carrier retail stores or other electronics stores like Best Buy (or manufacturer retail stores, if they have one near you) to try out the phones in person. Trying a display model won't give you the full picture of what it's like, but it can give you an idea. \n\nIf you have any questions for a fellow iPhone user who has been frustrated with Apple, also isn't a huge fan of Google, and is new to Android (I went with option 1 and still have both devices lol), feel free to reply or shoot me a message.",

Its not win10 where 50% of people are choosing not to upgrade ebecause they can't or won't. For android, either the device can and has been upgraded, or its too old to be upgraded, at which its probably thrown away; few people stick to old android partly because theres not many good reasons to stick with an older version unless you want to go pre material you. And with the recent push to force devs to update play store apps at least once a year, backwards compatibility is dependent on active devs and forward compatibility is at risk as the min SDK target keeps creeping up.\n\nYes, people below will say they won't upgrade their phones, thats great. I doubt the average android user does the same, and I think the distribution of OS versions recorded by google shows this. If I can get a pre material you style on my xperia 1 V I would but its too new to be downgraded. I had an galaxy s9 before and even if I wanted to upgrade that I cant, and the s9 or perhaps its successor the s10 can still be found sold by Samsung.",

The users there did nothing wrong, besides not being extra vigilant and whitelisting only their own IP addresses.\n\nAlso when someone is 'hacked', the average consumer just ends up factory resetting the device, or taking it to a shop where they handle it and don't really get into the details of what exactly happened.\n\nWhile I wouldn't say that every user needs to rush out and replace devices when security updates stop, but they should ask themselves if its worth the extra risk. Getting 'hacked' usually doesn't mean having your bank account accessed, but you might lose access to 'invaluable' photos/data, might get your CCs/SSN/email compromised, etc, it can be a nightmare for days/weeks/months.",

I'm in my 40's, I've had over 25 smartphones since they first came out, and I know from experience that big updates more often than not create more issues for me than they solve. Not to mention that they sometimes take away things that I use regularly, like when they locked down the android/data subfolders. So I'm glad you enjoy your more polished animations but clearly we have different priorities when it comes to our smartphones.\n\nEdit: It's also worth mentioning that the OneUI 7 update has clearly been plagued with issues based on all the delays.  That really does not help my confidence at all.",

People just want their phone to work and to stop getting changes for the sake of changes.\n\nThe split notification thing is a change for the sake of change.\n\nThere was literally no reason for it. It's just an annoyance for 99.99% of the user base. Thank fuck you can restore it to the previous functionality, but most people won't know about it.\n\nSame thing about the app drawer. Sure, you can bring back pagination, but the pagination is not weirdly sorted and you have to put icons back manually where you had them before. Change of the sake of change.\n\nRecent Apps now being a floaty slideshow? Again, sake for the sake of change, it makes seeing the content of my opened apps harder, 0 improvements there.\n\nMaterial You icons have changed color scheme. Why? How does *this* improve my usage? The inversed color scheme makes me pause briefly before I open up an App because my brain needs to parse the icon again, whereas before, I just instinctively knew which was which. \n\nWhen playing music, now I have a stupid \"dynamic island copy-cat shit\" on my notification bar. Completely useless, all text there is cropped, and it only serves to clutter my notification area.\n\nI also hate the new battery icon, but that's just aesthetics. \n\nI'm on OneUI 7, and I honestly can not notice *one* thing that makes my phone somehow \"better\" with this update. Ah yes, sure, newer android version, security patches and the works, but I didn't need drastic UI/UX changes for that.",

The other is a scheduling tool for D&D groups, because trying to coordinate six adult nerds is harder than building the actual app.\n\nI posted about testing earlier. It was swiftly executed by the Reddit algorithmic Inquisition™ – presumably for being “self-promotion,” even though I was asking for feedback, not fame or funding.\n\nSo, before I commit another unspeakable atrocity like *talking about my actual work*, I’d love to ask:  \n👉 **Where can indie devs ask for testers without stepping on subreddit landmines?**  \n👉 Is there a sticky thread I missed? A secret handshake? A mod blood pact?\n\nIf anyone’s curious (or bored), you can check the apps here:  \n🔗 [https://stiffer.se/apps.html]()  \n(Feedback, sarcasm, or helpful roasting welcome – I’m here for it.)\n\nThanks in advance, unless this gets deleted too, in which case… thanks for nothing 🙃",

                "comment": "it can sound obnoxious, but I think it's important to remember that iOS vs Android devices are two very different products conceptually. An android device is a general purpose computing device, the owner can install software independent of the hardware or software manufacturer. An iOS device is not, it's more akin to an appliance. It does what the manufacturer allows, and the user hopes that the manufacturer's supported usesl cases align with their own. Neither of these approaches is wrong from the user perspective, purchasing an appliance from a trusted vendor is a perfectly fine choice to make. But if we're comparing these two options, it can't just be simplified to \"customization\" options on Android. It's more accurately Ownership, in that the end user is able to control the software on the device independent of the manufacturer. This may not matter to you, and again that's valid, but in my view that's the key distinction. I don't need Samsung or Google to sign off on what software I run on my computer, and choosing the platform that moves us in the direction of user freedom is a priority for me. Does that mean every iOS user is stupid and bringing about the end of general purpose computing? Absolutely not, but I would argue that Apple is, and that's why I prefer to support Android device vendors over iOS. I don't feel that it's right to let a single trillion dollar company decide what I can do with my computer, so I support the only viable (but far from perfect) alternative.",

Tap on the notification to take action on it right now\n\n2. Simply close the notification feed because I want to deal with it later for whatever reason. (there is also snooze to accomplish the same thing, but not all apps support this yet.\n\n3. Swipe the notification because I want to dismiss it. \"Dismiss\" does NOT mean I want to deal with it later, and this should be clear because we've already covered that in option 2.\n\nSo what's the deal with so many apps now resurfacing that same notification 2 or 3 times, even if there is no more information from the app (another text, another email, whatever).  It's infuriating. In most cases, the only way to get it to stop is to disable the app's ability to send notifications at all. So I now you have either a super clogged feed full of repeat notifications, or you turn them all off. Both of these options severely degrade the android experience\n\nDo people like and request this or something?",

Some Motorola and Nothing devices still have fairly simple rooting processes, but the custom ROM support tends to be lacking (in Motorola's case) or just significantly behind Pixels. Redmi devices are probably the best in terms of pure custom ROM support (as far as I can tell), but you may experience delays with your unlocking since you have to get the code directly from the manufacturer (the last I was aware) and that can result in notable delays.",

Increased revenue through cost cutting, increased service price. Add all the political uncertainty into the mix, and coasting makes even more sense. \n\nThere is one area I wish Android would innovate at though; \"smartphone-as-a-PC-replacement\".

It also allows you to see the strengths of various TV's in detail, instead of some broader score.\n\n> Who is doing it right, in your opinion?\n\nAssuming you mean phone camera reviews, I don't know of anyone, really, because there simply isn't a big enough market to justify the effort it'd take to thoroughly test everything in lab and in as controlled and repeatable of a field test as possible.",

Most vulnerabilities are very difficult to exploit without physical access or some other arbitrary requirements in combination. And if you don't expose your services to the Internet and only use VPN to access your services, while isolating untrusted devices with vlan, you are mostly golden. \n\n\nFor an android phone, you aren't even exposed to the Internet, you are almost always behind nat and firewall. The os is mostly locked down, if you only install trusted apps, you are facing almost no threat.\n\n\nPeople always doom and gloom and they upvote each other, but they are often unable to name some actual example of problem they encounter that can only be solved by security patches.

        "description": "I recently \"upgraded\" from my dying Pixel 4a to a second hand Samsung Galaxy S22. \n\nFor the most part it's a very similar experience. I install Nova Launcher, I set things up the way I like, disabled Bixby etc. Sure, some things are different. The quick settings shade is different, I'm not a fan of how it takes an extra step to access subtitles for audio. Small things but no big deal.\n\nBut then I discover that they just... Removed the ability to set notifications as priority. If you long press on a notification, \"priority\" isn't an option.\n\nWhat's even more confusing, is that you technically CAN do this for SOME apps, but only for chat apps which integrate with the Conversations API, and it feels like a janky workaround. So the system to manage priority notifications is there, and it works, but you can't set any notification you like to be priority. Why?? \n\nFor extra confusion, it seems the was removed as part of a recent update to OneUI. This feature existed, technically still does exist, but they just removed the buttons and made you need to rely on a separate set of settings to access it in a roundabout way for only some apps.\n\nWhy???\n\nThis post is as much a rant about this specific problem as it is asking for comments on theories as to why OEMs do this, other experiences you may have had. I'm used to seeing \"extra\" features added by OEMs but why on earth would you remove access to something that's already there under the hood?",

OEMs often gives more power than actually needed by processors to keep it stable for all users as not all silicone is equal.\n\nEssentially it's like people, they recommend an adult male eats like 2500 cals per day but some don't need that much, undervolting is about finding the lower amount that is just enough not to lose weight or start passing out (programs crashing or device failing to run).\n\nIn doing so, you can can make a device produce more power for less - less heat and less battery consumption, which you can either use to boost performance power higher at no cost or to have more efficiency and lower temps at equal performance \n\nIt's a must for power users!!\n\nHaving this available for stock, CPU and GPU both, would be fucking insane and worth it!!",
