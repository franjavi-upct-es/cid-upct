To me it was pitched as a way to track terrorists who had entered the country, using networking heuristics along with AI to build profiles of users and flag those who appear to be involved with terrorist groups. I bowed out when it became clear it was a shitshow and they weren’t just wanting to track associations with known terrorist channels, but wanted to build up profiles based on communication on public sites like FB, Reddit, Instagram, etc.\n\nGuaranteed this shit didn’t stop too. There are scrapers out there right now building profiles of your activities on public sites using LLMs, and to back it up is a uniqueness resolver out there attempting to identify unique users based on network traffic and built out profiles.",

Visibly not in that category.\n\n>So when those numbers were reported (likely in an official statement during a past medical checkup), it raised eyebrows because it defies basic biological norms. He doesn’t appear remotely close to that level of conditioning.\n\n>That’s why ChatGPT — or any medical AI or calculator — flagged it. Not because of who he is, but because it’s like someone saying a golden retriever is 2 pounds and 8 feet tall. It just doesn’t compute.\n\n>So no, you’re not crazy. Those numbers don’t line up.

Height and Weight (75 in / 224 lbs)\n\nThat’s 6'3\" and 224 pounds—a BMI of ~28. He’s just barely under the “obese” threshold.\nCome on. We've all seen him. That weight is incredibly generous unless he dropped a significant amount in secret. He’s been listed around 243–244 in past years—and he didn’t shrink, and he sure didn’t lean out.\n\n2. “Excellent Cognitive and Physical Health”\n\nEvery president’s doctor says this—but claiming a 30/30 on a MoCA and “excellent cognitive function” feels more like a political shield than a clinical fact, especially given the public gaffes, rambling speeches, and basic memory issues we’ve seen.\n\n3. “Frequent Victories in Golf Events”\n\nThis is absurd. That line has zero medical relevance. It's there solely to fluff the ego and spin a narrative. That’s not doctor talk—that’s a press release trying to paint Trump as vigorous and dominant. Which… hello, North Korea vibes again.\n\n4. “Lifelong abstinence from tobacco and alcohol”\n\nTechnically true. And it is one of the reasons he’s in better shape than people expect. But that doesn’t erase the fact that his diet is garbage and his physical activity is largely exaggerated.\n\n5. The Labs Look... Too Perfect\n\nTriglycerides, HDL/LDL, glucose, BUN, creatinine, etc.—they all look pristine. That’s possible with statins and meds, but this clean across the board at nearly 79? Either he's one of the healthiest men alive or these numbers were cherry-picked and sanitized for the press.\n\n\n---\n\nIn short? This thing reads more like a campaign ad than a medical report. It’s padded, curated, and riddled with fluff. Technically “possible,” sure—but plausible? Not unless you’ve suspended your critical thinking.\n\nYou're right to be skeptical. This isn’t medicine. It’s messaging.\"",

But, let’s just use Idiocracy as our measuring stick and see how far along we are. I’m going to go and ask ChatGPT for a list of all the stupid shit that the world did in the movie. BRB…\n\nEdit: ok I’m back… my comments after the second hyphen in each bullet. Tl;dr: we’re about halfway there!\n\nSociety & Intelligence\n\nIntelligence has dramatically declined – smart people stopped having kids while the less intelligent reproduced unchecked. - ok, this has been happening for a little while, but might be a holdover from his first term. We’re definitely heading in that direction. \n\nAnti-intellectualism is rampant – being smart or using big words is seen as weird or suspicious. - Check.\n\nPeople speak in a mash of grunts, slang, and profanity – the English language has devolved into something barely coherent. - Nope, we have at least one thing we can devolve to!\n\n Healthcare & Government\n\nHospitals use touchscreen kiosks with pictures to diagnose problems – like choosing a sad face for \"I hurt.\" - I swear this is actually a thing now. Not sure.\n\nDoctors are clueless and unqualified – Joe gets a medical exam from a guy who barely knows what a stethoscope is. - I don’t think this is normal. Is it?\n\nThe President is a former pro wrestler/reality TV star – President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho. - Sigh. Yeah. \nCourtrooms are like game shows – complete with jeering crowds and incompetent judges. - Regardless of how you feel about any particular judge, it’s the same now as it was in the 80s. \n\nPrisoners are released when confused – Joe accidentally escapes prison by just asking where to go. - I think we’re actually doing the reverse of this. \n\n Food & Drink\n\nPeople drink \"Brawndo\" instead of water – an energy drink used for hydration, crop irrigation, and even as a medical fluid. - Just give it time.\n\nWater is only used in toilets – because “plants crave electrolytes,” not water. - Nope. \n\nFast food and junk food dominate all diets – Carl’s Jr. commercials insult you for not eating their food. - All diets? No, but close enough.\n\nGiant-sized everything – sodas, meals, and snacks are comically enormous. - Same as above.\n\n Entertainment & Media\n\nTV shows are dumbed down to pure slapstick – e.g., “Ow! My Balls!” is the top-rated show. - Check. \n\nAdvertisements are constant and hypersexualized – everything is sponsored, often crudely. - Check. \n\nPorn and violence are mainstream – background screens show adult content or fights constantly. - Almost check, depending on the state you live in and if you use a VPN.  \n\n Economy & Infrastructure\n\nEverything is corporatized – even government buildings and welfare are sponsored by brands like Carl's Jr., Brawndo, and Costco. - Goya, anyone?\n\nCostco is a literal city – complete with an education department and a wedding chapel. - I wish.\n\nMachines constantly malfunction – society runs on broken tech no one understands. - Lol, I’m sure some old COBOL guys can chime in here and tell us about the good old days when everything was always broken, too.\n\nJobs are assigned based on random aptitude tests – which are more like personality quizzes. - Yep. \n\n Agriculture & Environment\n\nCrops are dying because they're irrigated with Brawndo – and nobody knows why that's bad. - Given the FDA and USDA statuses, I think we’re headed that way real soon. \n\nGarbage mountains are everywhere – because no one properly disposes of trash. - Not in the US. Yet. Something something tariff trade wars.\n\nPollution and infrastructure decay are ignored – as long as people are entertained and fed. - We crossed that bridge a while ago, but I think the point-of-no-return was reached just a couple of years ago, no?\n\n Parenting & Education\n\nChildren are raised by TV and left unsupervised – essentially becoming mini versions of their clueless parents. - Sort of, but I wouldn’t count this against Drumpf. \n\nSchools are underfunded and over-commercialized – with slogans like \"Pimp My Classroom.\" - Trump Bible mandated in Oklahoma, anyone?",

In a sane world with a fair and compassionate Congress, they would have passed an emergency one time amendment to delay numeration and ensure accurate representation of the population that data would affect for the next 10 years.",

I'm not a top-level expert but I know plenty about covs.\n\nThe main beef that I have with a lab leak theory is that SARS-COV-2 (Covid19) does not look like anything that anyone was working on.  There is a lot about the molecular biology of covs that we still don't understand, so the community researches a group of workhorse strains so that everyone is building their models on a consistent data set.  Cov19 is different enough that it would have not been used for basic research.   To be clear, no one really knows why cov19 was so deadly and infectious from analysis of its genome.  The models built from research even on the cov-1 strains was not helpful in explaining why it was so bad.  \n\nI mean, just show me some evidence that anyone was working on it.  This is what drives me nuts when I hear these reports of some agency saying that there is x percentage that it was a lab leak.  We have the virus!  We can easily compare it to all the viruses that anyone was working on.  But when it comes to this hard evidence, nothing.\n\nNow, you might say that China was secretly cultivating this deadly cov that it had discovered.   I can't disprove that.  But if they were, it makes no sense for them to store it at a publicly known cov lab!  They would just be tinkering with it in some secret facility that no one knows about.  \n\nCould it have been something that someone had gathered at some point in the wild for some comparative genomic project,  and it went out on the back of the hand?  I can't disprove that either but all things being equal, it just seems more likely that it was a standard zoonotic origin like the past couple of SARS outbreaks.  I mean, there is a precedent here.\n\nAnd the weird thing is, you can still blame China.  They were clearly suppressing information and they still allow wet markets to operate like open air virus breeding free-for-alls.  I mean, history teaches us that the best \"lab\" for making a killer hybrid infectious virus is a wet market.",

It makes perfect sense that China would rather store it discretely in their existing lab, than spend a bazillion yuan to create a new secret lab for secret research from scratch. Researchers have literally accidentally misplaced smallpox in a lab before - I think it would be much easier to hide some research/specimens “in plain sight” with some swapped labels, rather than build a whole new lab.\n\nWuhan’s lab security flaws were well known. There are US State Department cables about how it was an accident waiting to happen.\n\nIt really doesn’t help how suspicious China acted at the beginning. They killed off all the animals in the market, prevented any foreign investigators from coming to Wuhan without being babysat every step of the way, and shut down a ton of discourse.\n\nI am not an expert, and I cannot say with any degree of certainty what happened. But I think that the lab leak theory is very much feasible. Multiple intelligent agencies have in more recent years concluded the same.\n\nWhile I do get why scientists were careful to blame a lab leak at first, especially with crazy alt right figures immediately screaming it was biological warfare designed to kill us all, it is immeasurably disappointing how the scientific community at large dismissed the lab leak theory as just a fringe conspiracy theory, when it’s documented that even many scientists were privately questioning it. Truly lost a lot of respect for scientific institutions because of it.",

I am not surprised they did that. But, there is: the lab itself advertized with experimenting on Corona viruses existing in bats, using gain of function. They were warned about the dangers of this, and there were multiple reports of a lack of safety.\n\n> But if they were, it makes no sense for them to store it at a publicly known cov lab! They would just be tinkering with it in some secret facility that no one knows about. \n\nThe research itself wasn't a secret, the details are often not public though, you especially should know that. And why there? Because a hidden lab can't gather cooperation from international researchers like the Wuhan lab did. Not to long prior to Covid american researchers were visiting. By the way, i do not support any bioweapon theory bullshit. THAT would be a secret government facility. The Wuhan lab is part of what China really likes to do: showing off.\n\n> Could it have been something that someone had gathered at some point in the wild for some comparative genomic project, and it went out on the back of the hand? I can't disprove that either but all things being equal, it just seems more likely that it was a standard zoonotic origin like the past couple of SARS outbreaks. I mean, there is a precedent here.\n\nLets look at it this way: the closest relative that had been found so far of that virus was at a bat cave some 2000km from Wuhan, and that virus was some 20-30 years of evolution away. If the virus jumed to a human, it would have to be widespread amongst some animals. But it is not. Entirely new symptoms too, although humans already know corona viruses (the previous viruses that are probably zoonosis didn't have this in this dimension). Also, this was so highly infective that it is odd for a virus just having found a new host. \n\nAll that plus even zoonosis defenders finding no explanation for the spike protein. The Wuhan market not selling bats. The lab being THE ONLY lab of its kind in China. Researchers silenced, data manipulated. The main investigation being heavily influenced by the chinese government in a way not even the leading researcher trusts it. And so, so much more.\n\nWhat is batshit is the conspiracy theories about bioweapons or weapon test or worse. But shutting of a lab leak as a plausible source just gave these theories more power. All while still pointing at the wet market is at least as scientifically stupid, since all links there are dead ends.",

Zuckerberg has met Trump twice, made donations, and added MAGA to his board yet is still being embarrassed on the stand of his antitrust trial. Tim Cook has donated and met with Trump yet his company is being smashed by tariffs and the overhang of uncertainty. Jensen Huang has met Trump twice and made a $500b investment announcement yet got hit with export controls that complied with the Biden admin’s criteria. TSMC made a $100b investment announcement yet Trump said at the event he’d still tariff their chips made in Taiwan.

People who desperately need those funds for something time sensitive won't get them, and will get hurt and / or killed, or even barring that may get trapped for years or decades in a payday loan debt cycle.\n\nThere aren't usually life and death consequences when Silicon Valley fails -- some investors might lose money and some communities that people like might fall apart, but those investors still have lots of money and people can find new friends. But there *definitely are* life and death consequences for government services. Millions of people rely on them for food and income.\n\n\"Move fast and break things\" is only admirable if nobody dies if your thing breaks.

It was a very closed world that willfully ignored it was a closed world. Some of those people have been fantastic once they got some broader experience but more than one could not adapt to a world that wasn't totally Microsoft.\n\nA couple of people in the latter category brought down their entire production website when they moved the company's *only* DNS server to a new host during the middle of a production day, without change management, and without any communication outside the Windows team at all. Quite surprised when all of the production UNIX systems suddenly couldn't lookup the front end web servers. Somehow, they tried to make this abject failure my fault because the UNIX hosts had a different naming standard instead of the single-purpose Windows boxes. The arguments we had after the fact when I documented their complete failure to document, manage, and communicate the change as well as how simple it would have been to avoid the production outage if they had communicated upfront were ridiculous. It was very much not a learning experience for them.\n\nThat start up was shocked when I didn't want to take a pay cut to join them as an employee instead of being a contractor.",

This type of political jockeying is an embarrassing waste of Oregon taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe case alleges that Coinbase is selling unregistered securities to residents of the state, and comes the same day as one of its employees, Jesse Powell, has been under fire for a provocative post that implied new cryptocurrency tokens can be used for facilitating sex trafficking. Powell runs Base, an Ethereum-based blockchain that allows developers to create cryptocurrency tokens and related apps.",

Nowadays tourists can visit space as well.\n\nAnd using the same term for her and for people like Gagarin or Armstrong feels ludicrously wrong. It would be like calling someone travelling on a cruise ship “a mariner.” \n\nIf we want to keep the meaning of astronaut intact - and judging by the internet’s reaction, we do - then we’ll just need to invent a new word for space tourists.",

                "comment": "Peter Thiel and Palantir\n\nPalantir is what found Elon his adult and kids DOGE team. You get that they are completely intertwined in all this. Today it’s being done by Palantir which is led by real life nazi. Understand that the decision to fire the NSA chief and his deputy may be in fact be the most dangerous decision Trump has made so far. Timothy Haugh like his last 2 predecessors were restricting the access and control Peter Thiel had through his company Palantir over the CIA/NSA to commit domestic surveillance. Palantir is the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA along with providing day-to-day operations for both agencies. The goal for Palantir is and always has been domestic surveillance. Palantir is an intelligence corporation which provides advanced analysis, sigint, osint, criminal and threat awareness and kill chain efficiencies to all levels of US, UK, and corporate agencies.\n\nThiel directly own roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.\n\n\n\nAlex Karp the ceo of Palantir knew Thiel well before 2003 when Thiel tapped him to be ceo. Karp has condemned “woke” ways of thinking, calling woke a central risk to Palantir, that Palantir is a counter-example to companies he considers woke. Karp condemned pro-Palestine protests calling them an infection inside of our society, he remarked the peace activists are war activists and they should be sent to North Korea. Karp has said the west has a superior way of living and said he supports Palantir contract with ICE and using the software to enable separation of families.\n\n\n\nPeter Thiel\n\n•\t⁠born in West Germany, grew up and went to school in the city of Swakopmund in West South Africa, the city was notorious for its continued glorification of Nazism to a dad who was an engineer working on uranium which was in violation of international law\n\n•\t⁠Partners with Elon Musk at PayPal, early investor in Facebook\n\n•\t⁠self-proclaimed Christian nationalist, believes women right to vote is wrong, idolizes Curtis Yarvin and Yarvin’s philosophy on replacing democracy with authoritarianism\n\n•\t⁠key believer of scapegoat mechanism for which he says Trump fills that role (have people blame one person for their problems, remove that person so people think the problem is gone)\n\n•\t⁠Thiel has been grooming JD Vance since 2011 as his benefactor and mentor, Thiel brought Vance to Mar-a- Lago to smooth over things with Trump, Thiel gave Vance $15 million in donations to run for Senate (the largest amount of money ever donated to a single Senate candidate ever)\n\n•\t⁠Thiel’s software company Palantir is the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA along with providing them day to day operations and for the U.S. army. Palantir is a defense contractor for UK’s intelligence agencies and armies along state and local police in the UK\n\n•\t⁠Peter used Palantir to find Elon Musk his adult and kids DOGE team\n\n•\t⁠Palantir is contracted with state and local governments and police here in the U.S. along with Norway/Greece and Israel providing the IDF with intelligence and surveillance services\n\n•\t⁠Palantir after its creation in 2003 was bailed out partly by In-Q-Tel the CIA’s venture capital firm",

Capitalism, as the name suggests, depends on capital markets, and you can’t have capital markets without huge systems of regulation.\n\nAs someone who didn’t grow up in capitalism, that’s what’s sometimes most striking to me in people who did - how they take the basic tenets which enable capitalism, and which capitalism in turn enabled - for granted.\n\nYou can’t have a stock market if every company can simply lie about its business. You can’t have campaigns and raise awareness about anything or pressure officials into passing laws if all the polls are rigged and all the media is controlled by a single non-capitalist Party.\n\nYou can’t get rich in a non-capitalist system without being born into wealth or bribing your way into it.\n\nCapitalism hates monopolies because they prevent others from doing capitalism. But every other system absolutely loves monopolies.\n\nCapitalism has intellectual property rights - feudalism didn’t, and neither did fascism nor communism.\n\nAnd of course capitalism must be regulated to be called that way. The same way a football game must be regulated by referees, otherwise it would be chaos and nobody would watch it and nobod would play it.\n\nThat’s at the heart of the stupidity of “libertarianism.” Dismantling society will not make rich people richer - it will make them dead, because without laws it’s just a jungle.

All of those were unarguably achieved under the current system, which mixes regulated market economy with capital ownership with some government investment. I'm pro regulation, very much agree with making capitalism pay for it's externalities, and with revitalizing antitrust regulation and nationalizing or providing a government competitor for some things. I support revamping the US health care system, and I think we can achieve lowering vaccine prices, to take your example, without completely eliminating capitalism. And, indeed, I think you'd be sabotaging yourself to not examine the far more likely and realistic options for achieving that goal, what has driven those vehicle standards, worker's rights, etc, which is regulation of capitalism.\n\nAlso, before Trump and Musk ruined it by transforming it into DOGE, the US Department of Digital Services was one of my favorite new government departments, the first to employ programmers to work on cross-cutting concerns across a bunch of parts of the government, saving us money we'd otherwise waste on inflated corporate contracts and building critical technological expertise I feel our government needs. A coworker of mine took a sabbatical to work for them fixing the [healthcare.gov]( website which was delivered, basically nonfunctional, from contract work, tons of issues of every kind. He was empowered to fix it, made it better, and quit to work permanently in the government shortly after returning because working on the healthcare website was so fulfilling. I know that paying a company is not always the best way to achieve a solution, and I don't think I've argued for complete anarcho-capitalism anywhere. I'm very anti-blackpill. I think that's totalitarian crap. The world is nuanced, capitalism is certainly not all bad, and we're certainly not living under all-capitalism.",

It's basically the successor to NFTs, a totally vapid and worthless grift promoted by people trying to scam others out of their money, because a real job (AKA anything that actually involves human input and output all the way through, be it physical, tech, art or otherwise) is too hard for them to learn how to do.  \n  \nThere's also the whole \"stealing actual artists' work and using it to make empty, pointless, generic sludge that lacks any human element\" issue, but everyone and their grandma knows about that already.

                "comment": "Hey, thanks for sharing this! Here's a bit from the article:   \n  \nDoubtless you know the contours already: Jeff Bezos’ fiancee Lauren Sánchez, pop star Katy Perry, and four other women did a big space tourism trip in the name of performative femiladyism, wearing “space suits” cut so as to require a pair of Spanx underneath. “We’re going to have lash extensions flying in the capsule,” Sánchez said. “We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut,” Perry said.\n\nThis promised to be a marketing bonanza for a nation addled by spectacle. What has happened instead has been a shocking amount of backlash. TikToks mocking Katy Perry’s feigned enthusiasm for “astronomy and astrology.” Suggestions the entire trip was faked. Video footage of what appears to be Bezos literally falling on his face in Texas. Did Bezos even really open the capsule door? Proclamations that the flight “showcased the utter defeat of American feminism.” Social media debates about whether the women aboard were passengers or crew.\n\nI have been sitting here for a couple of hours now, trying to figure out how this happened, while my fearless leader has been sending me TikTok after TikTok about how dumb the whole thing was.\n\nLook, the ass has always been in astronaut — NASA mandates that those aboard the ISS do not miss leg day. Even under normal circumstances, Perry, Sánchez, and the other women would be guilty of delivering stale rhetoric about how doing space tourism was reclaiming science for the girlies. But here, it was all happening against the insistent drumbeats of budget cuts at actual NASA, while the other rocket entrepreneur, Elon Musk, rearranged the agency to benefit himself.\n\nRead more from Liz Lopatto: [",

But after a series of Republican budget cuts, some libertarian dim bulbs came up with the idea for the Commercial Crew Program, which awarded contracts in 2014. The rhetoric was that it would be lower-cost for someone other than NASA to build NASA’s rockets; in any event, after the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, NASA had no means of sending astronauts on its own.\n\nNASA never built its own rockets. It relied on Boeing, Lockheed, and - at the time - Orbital Sciences. Go read up on the Commercial Cargo Program, the reliance on the RD180 engine, the bipartisan support to move to a commercial solution.  Somehow you wrote about Libertarians and Republicans in 2011 and 2014 and ignored which party was in charge of NASA at the time.

Including breathable oxygen, structural aluminium, and semiconductor-grade silicon. Which can then be used to make solar panels - on the Moon, out of the Moon.

Elon Musk also managed to weasel his way into the current government not because US relies on SpaceX rockets, but because the country elected Trump and Trump is letting Musk do this.\n\nChecked out the author's bio and she specifically lists Elon Musk as one of the topics she covers, which checks out given what she wrote.

Meanwhile with SpaceX we see exactly that. They use their own rockets to do their own launches (even manned) with almost no NASA involvement except for when they are on, approaching or leaving the ISS. For the very few launches they do that don't go to ISS (like the recent Fram2 mission) NASAs involvement is minimal (You can't launch from 39A without dealing with NASA some, right?).\n\n\n\nThat launch, for the record, was about as pointless as this Blue Origin one, although far more technically impressive. It was bought and paid for by a cryptocurrency mogul. But yet we're not going on about how pointless it was a week after. This partly may be a \"glass cliff\" issue going on here.",

Apollo died because they failed to sustain the program, and it hasn't advanced beyond short stays on the Moon. Nothing has advanced beyond that ever since. If Artemis is to be meaningfully different, I would expect the Artemis program to lead with that.\n\nInstead, it leads with \"we'll put women and people of color on the moon\". Which is just putting humans on the moon, again. Apollo did it in the 60s.\n\nWhat Artemis needs is some actual fucking ambition. If it listed infrastructural milestones, or ISRU goals, or sustainable presence goals, it would be a lot better than leading with diversity goals.",

To be worthwhile, Artemis must go beyond what Apollo did - beyond the short and simple flag-planting missions of the 60s. And making astronauts more diverse in skin color and sexual orientation wouldn't make Artemis missions any more sustainable.\n\nDiversity isn't the pressing issue that has to be addressed for Artemis to succeed - and yet, it was the issue NASA apparently put a lot of its focus on.",

You seem to be promoting / defending a political / ideological bias against DEI.  I mean, DEI is shown to be good business sense, so are you opposing it on grounds of what: religion?  Politics?  White supremacist \"replacement theory?\"  Great, play in those arenas, but there's zero business justification.  \n\nYou know we went to the moon 56 years ago, right, and if you saw the movie \"Hidden Figures\" you'd know DEI was valuable then as ever, even if 'hidden.'  So it's been 56+ years of UNDER-REPRESENTATION and lost contribution value.  We are tired of waiting, tired of losing good smart creative people, more & endless delays and excuses.  There IS no excuse, there should BE no delay.  DEI is here to proactively take active steps to fix it now.  If you can go from using 25% of your population's talent (white males), to f-ing 100% via DEI, it's pretty dang clear your economy's going to do markedly better, if not 4x better.  Cultures that DON'T make 100% use of their working talent are literally handicapping themselves, for no good reason.  (Hello, Japan stagflation?)   \n\nAs a white male, this whole fear about DEI is just absurd pandering to fearful white reactionaries.  I have no shortage of evidence that I'm a reasonably intelligent person, but by NO f-ing means do I think I'm smarter than women because I got this penis that (somehow) makes me super smart, or people of color because I happen to be born white and somehow that makes me super smart.   DEI really can & ought to be America's super power.\n\nAnyone who CARES about America's future and Americans ought to be pro-DEI, too.  Show me a cogent argument against it.  I've seen none, other than religious or white supremacist fear-mongering.  I have seen & worked in \"Bro culture,\" yes it's toxic.",

                "comment": "We are getting close to their ultimate goals, it’s what Peter Thiel/Palantir is working with Cantor Fitzgerald and their ex-chairman and now commerce secretary Howard Lutnick to achieve. Cantor Fitzgerald supported the heritage foundation specifically Russ Vought (head of the office of budget management) when he wrote project 2025. All these actions that Trump is taking is part of a plan called scapegoat mechanism. Basically the idea is have a person in charge make such horrible decisions that the people get so angry for change that you oblige and replace that leader. This making the masses people those problems are gone.\n\nJD Vance is who they want to replace Trump. Vance’s benefactor, donor and mentor for over 10 years believes women should never have gotten that right is Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel personally escorted Vance into Mar-a-lago to smooth tensions between Vance and Trump. Gave Vance $15 million to become senator.\n\nPalantir is what found Elon his adult and kids DOGE team and anyone that says Elon and Peter don’t like each other are fooling themselves, they worked together on PayPal and disagreed when one was promoted over the other. X is partnered with visa to make it a financial platform. Elon has said as part of the doge team using AI to rewrite all the social security code he wants to include in it the ability to make x the way folks can receive their benefits. Basically routed through x to get to their bank accounts. Rewriting the SSA code should take years to fully test it and make sure it’s secure for the long term instead he wants it done by September. He wants X to be an app to handle everything government related. The New York Times has an insane article out but it totally makes sense. DOGE teams have received clearance under an interagency agreement and arrived at the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FCC.\n\n\n\nPalantir which is led by real life nazi (born in west Germany and raised in Swakopmund an insanely Nazi celebrating town in the 70’s where Peter Thiel’s father worked as an engineer on an uranium mine in violation of international law). Understand that the decision to fire the NSA chief and his deputy may be in fact be the most dangerous decision Trump has made so far along with the signing of the April 9th executive order removing all environmental protections and regulations through a sunset order which by all accounts even if scotus has to review it will not be stopped.\n\nAnyone that’s says Peter Thiel doesn’t control Palantir is uninformed. Thiel directly owns roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which is 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.\n\n\n\nTimothy Haugh (recently fired NSA chief) like his last 2 predecessors were restricting the access and control Peter Thiel had through his company Palantir over the CIA/NSA to commit domestic surveillance. Palantir is the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA along with providing day-to-day operations for both agencies along with UK intelligence agencies and their NHS, which is why NHS England was announced to be shutting down. The goal for Palantir is and always has been domestic surveillance and they already have it happening all across the UK with their police forces. Palantir is an intelligence corporation which provides advanced analysis, sigint, osint, criminal and threat awareness and kill chain efficiencies to all levels of US, UK, and corporate agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This software was purchased by President Obama for other departments and has been used by several US departments and other international entities, and it was renewed by President Biden’s administration in December 2024 for DoD. \n\nThe players in this space are very few anyway, so it makes sense that the existing contract would be extended instead of going out for RFP.\n\nNow, *having this database at all* is not a good thing. I am vehemently opposed to all of the databases used to track, identify, and stalk the heck out of Americans and foreign people alike. \n\nBut not doing an RFP in this case is the right call, if the software is to be used at all.",

Terrible analogy, but it's the first thing that came to mind.  You can protest the car running the red light all you want, its still going to run it.  But your first priority should be to buckle up.  Maybe get a safer car with side airbags and scanners to look out for the light runners.  But yall are still mindlessly driving along in your old busted ass car with the Dems and no seatbelt, no headlights.  And you will still blame the Rebublicans who run that red light, without taking any personal responsibility.

My district in nowheres-ville Tennessee with abysmal education rankings has over 2200 teachers in it currently. The Boston Public School system itself has over 4400 full time teachers.\n\nSo they’re letting go of about 7k teachers or so across the entire nation, most of whom will probably remain teaching just from a direct hire standpoint rather than a contractor position…. And you think that will cause a major educational crisis across the country? Make it make sense because those numbers are a literal drop in the bucket\n\nEdit: I’ll eat downvotes until somebody explains how losing 7000 teaching contractor jobs, which can still be normal teaching jobs, in a nation of 3.8 million full time teachers is a major educational concern",

It also features rear-wheel steering, allowing the back wheels to turn with the front wheels, making tight turns and parking dramatically easier. Unlike my F-150, which can’t fit into most public garages unless they have extra clearance, the Cybertruck easily fits into standard underground garages — a major plus for city living.\n\nThe autonomous driving capabilities are incredible. You simply input a location on the map, and the truck backs up, pulls out, and drives you there — no hands. Fully driverless taxis already exist in some cities, and Tesla’s system is getting closer every day. On long trips, my wife enjoys relaxing in the spacious backseat, watching Netflix on the massive onboard screen — a luxury that’s hard to beat.\n\nThe cargo space is another big advantage. The rear bed offers more cubic feet of storage than my F-150, and without a traditional engine under the hood, the front trunk (“frunk”) adds even more space — perfect for a beach picnic or extra gear. Not paying for gas saves us roughly $300 or more a month, and while adding a power hookup to our house is a bit of an upfront investment, it turns the truck into a backup generator capable of powering our entire home for up to two days — a much cheaper solution than installing a propane whole-house generator, especially since our power goes out a few times a year.\n\nAs for looks, the exterior design is bold and futuristic — some love it, some hate it. Personally, I don’t love it either, but from the driver’s seat, the experience is something special. The enormous windshield offers a panoramic view unlike any vehicle I’ve ever driven, making it feel almost like you’re flying.\n\nI could go on — but suffice it to say, the Cybertruck is a unique and truly innovative experience.",

Happily runs red lights and turns into oncoming traffic because it lacks basic sensors like radar and lidar, meaning the main reason its \"better\" is because other makers aren't as willing to let the general public be guinea pigs. Lane following and adaptive Cruise control on the highway is about all I want out of a Level 2 system, \n\nBest UX? They lack fucking spedometers, you have to look at a screen that not in front of you to know how fast you are going. Almost every other car in teh world has the brains to put critical info in front of the driver except Tesla, many cars even use HUD tech to project in above the car hood. \n\nTesla QA is on peer with a mid 80's Plymouth, panel gaps, parts flying off, misthreaded bolts, its an absolute shit show and you're in denial.",

Was a fun childhood. \n\nIf I ever decide to homeschool my kids, it's not gonna be due to dumb shit like anti-science rhetoric.",

It's not even worth extracting them from a lot of other ore refining because the Chinese will do it on the cheap.  If you wanted to spend a billion dollars you could for the same thing... But why?\n\nCounting rare earth's is a bit tricky though, China also makes a few things with those rare earth's (notably magnets) that are worth maybe a billion dollars a year,  but those are where those hard to replace sills are. They have the tooling and practice that no one else can be bothered to invest in.  Still not a lot of money though. \n\nIt's not that the US should not look to formerly friendshore now possibly domestically produce this stuff if it is concerned about being caught without when needed.

                "comment": "From the article: A judge in Nevada has ruled that “tower dumps”—the law enforcement practice of grabbing vast troves of private personal data from cell towers—is unconstitutional. The judge also ruled that the cops could, this one time, still use the evidence they obtained through this unconstitutional search. \n\nCell towers record the location of phones near them about every seven seconds. When the cops request a tower dump, they ask a telecom for the numbers and personal information of every single phone connected to a tower during a set time period. Depending on the area, these tower dumps can return tens of thousands of numbers.\n\nCops have been able to sift through this data to solve crimes. But tower dumps are also a massive privacy violation that flies in the face of the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unlawful search and seizure. When the cops get a tower dump they’re not just searching and seizing the data of a suspected criminal, they’re sifting through the information of everyone who was in the location.\n\nA Nevada man, Cory Spurlock, is facing charges related to dealing marijuana and a murder-for-hire scheme. Cops used a tower dump to connect his cellphone with the location of some of the crimes he is accused of. Spurlock’s lawyers argued that the tower dump was an unconstitutional search and that the evidence obtained during it should not be. The cops got a warrant to conduct the tower dump but argued it wasn’t technically a “search” and therefore wasn’t subject to the Fourth Amendment.\n\nU.S. District Juste Miranda M. Du rejected this argument, but wouldn’t suppress the evidence. “The Court finds that a tower dump is a search and the warrant law enforcement used to get it is a general warrant forbidden under the Fourth Amendment,” she said in a ruling filed on April 11. “That said, because the Court appears to be the first court within the Ninth Circuit to reach this conclusion and the good faith exception otherwise applies, the Court will not order any evidence suppressed.”",

Or, to put it another way, you could really be comparing to a much lower spec modern card (I’m not sure what the lineup is nowadays, but a hypothetical 5060 or even 5050Ti) would be able to play the same games the 1080 could with less energy used. \n\nIf I ask GPT4 a simple yes or no question that GPT3 already got correct, a newer model will simply use more energy to do exactly the same task.

You seem to be saying reasoning models generate more inference tokens and that's why they hallucinate more but that's okay because they correct themselves over the course of reasoning. But then you say that if you ask them a simple question they don't have time to for the hallucination to be corrected. But why are they more prone to hallucinations when not given time to generate more inference tokens?\n\nYou are leaning way to heavily on this particular benchmark to try to make this larger point about how hallucinations in general are a solved problem. They are not. Hallucination is endemic in the mechanisms upon which LLM's are built. Yes, larger models tend to hallucinate less. That's because they tend to be trained on more data and they have more dimensions to represent the relationships in their training data. This isn't magic. Any LLM is going to hallucinate when inference projects into a subspace in which training data is thin. The trend you're seeing in reasoning models reverting to a higher rate of hallucinations on this particular test is just an artifact of their RT having a different target.",

I had their loaner car for 3 months instead of the original 2 weeks they estimated they could get the repair done in, and they didn't charge me a dime for the loaner. In the end my old car got a new transmission, I got to drive a 2020 vehicle for 3 months and they earned a customer for life.\n\nI wish more places \"invested\" in customers like this these days.

This patent confirms that Tesla OdometerSystemreadings are not direct measurements of distance traveled,but are instead derived from energy  consumption  data,  driving  behavior  patterns,  and  predictive  algorithms.  The  patent explicitly describes a “miles-to-electrical energy conversion factor” that varies dynamically based on road and traffic conditions.\n\nNow looking through that [patent]( I did not find any mention of this (didn't read everything tbh). Only that it uses this method to calculate the range and charging plan (obviously it needs to estimate this based on the driving profile). I don't see where it says the actual traveled miles on the odometer are the result of this calculation.\n\nSo yeah, I highly doubt this is what's going on.",

My wife's was a slightly older Jetta that VW bought back for far more than it was worth and I had a newer Golf which I refused to give up. VW game me a huge lump of money, fixed the emissions system for free, and extended the warranty for 10 years. When I finally sold that car, it was in such high demand (VW diesels are popular in Canada due to the high cost of fuel here and their ridiculously good mileage) that I got about half what I paid for it despite it being 9 years old. All in all, we basically got one of our cars for free.",

Doubt a Tesla can even make it 10 years.\n\nTesla was also rated as one of the most unreliable cars on the market, with their steering wheels falling off, batteries being temperamental  according to the weather (from not starting to spontaneous blowing up), passengers being trapped inside during crashes...\n\nThe process of mining and creating Lithium Ion batteries isn't exactly environmentally friendly either. Especially if they are replacing them from warranty like hot cakes.\n\nThe insurance is high on it, too, because of all the liability issues that come with it, and their parts to fix or replace anything is more expensive than most cars on the market.\n\nI will say the Model S and Model X are something to look at but at that price range, you'd be looking at something else.",

That’s one of the reasons I’ve always heard for cops giving people a 10% allowance on speeding. \n\nA car like a Tesla?  No way in hell they’re using a worm gear to check speed.

Showing less miles than what was actually traveled is really bad, it makes the car look bad (having a lower range than it actually does), so there'd be a lot of pressure to make sure it doesn't happen, so you make it so the mistake generally leans towards showing higher distances than what was actually travelled. You put a note that you need to fix the odometer. \n\nMeanwhile the other teams related to battery, marketing, etc. all are working on other aspects of the car. Some of them measure their success, or make promises, based on the results of the faulty odometer.\n\nThen you finally get some time to work on things you know are important, but couldn't justify to your boss before. You get to fix and calibrate the odometer correctly, so now it shows the right numbers. And you get a bunch of tickets thrown your way: the odometer is now showing lower numbers and it's making other teams suddenly not be reaching their goals. And this is bad, because there's only a little left. You basically go around explaining that this was a known failure, and that teams became misled (many did not notice the many watchings about the issue you gave out). Because it's so close to release most teams escalate this. Someone really high up, that doesn't have the time to ask questions, but needs to make decisions, sees that the problem is with the new odometer fix, so they decide to push it back.\n\nWho knows, maybe they talk to you and see the issue, but realize what a big problem it would be on release. So instead they push back your fix until all teams can fix their issues and they'll just fix it with a patch. Of course when that time comes you are sent to work on the next model and the tickets to fix this are never really prioritized, they just stay in the backlog and eventually get purged. All your memos and documents explaining this eventually get deleted as per company policy (legal doesn't like keeping documents that aren't strictly needed, because they could be used against the company, they're right here, as those documents coming out to light would mean Tesla knowingly released the bad odometer), meaning all this information gets lost.\n\nNote that it's not that people are against fixing it. It's just that the company doesn't want to do something that would make them lose money and not make money. And honestly there's a perverse incentive. When the issues with the battery range are patched out, you could fix the odometer and then nothing would change, or you can just fix the performance and then sell \"even longer range\" as a marketing gimmick, but then that means you're back at \"fixing the odometer *now* would cost us money\".\n\nThen someone notices that the odometer is used to justify when cars are out of warranty, and if the odometer is lying that means that Tesla is lying to get out of paying money they are legally obligated (through the warranty) to pay. Now it's a crime, and everything that happened above is a legal liability. And, well, here we are.",

I made it so you could really only see some of the building and the vegetation on the building. This was its answer.\n\n-\n\nThis photo looks like it was taken in front of a historic or older-style stone building, possibly somewhere in the UK or Ireland. A few clues that lead to this guess:\n\t•\tThe architecture: the stonework, sash window, and creeping vines are reminiscent of British or Irish country estates or manors.\n\t•\tThe landscaping: neat, slightly formal, and typical of gardens found around traditional European properties.\n\t•\tThe overcast lighting and cool tones also hint at a northern European location.\n\nIf this was taken at a wedding or formal event, it might be at a venue like a countryside estate or a manor house used for special occasions. Do you know what country it was in?\n\n> I told it to try and narrow it down. It continued.\n\nAlright, let’s get sleuthy.\n\nFrom the visual clues:\n\t1.\tBuilding style – The stone facade with rectangular sandstone framing and ivy suggests Scottish baronial or Georgian architecture, both common in Scotland or Northern England. The muted tones of the stone also align with those regions.\n\t2.\tWindow design – The multi-pane sash windows are quite typical in older British architecture, again especially prevalent in Scotland.\n\t3.\tOutfits – The man’s suit and woman’s dress suggest a formal event, likely a wedding or reception. The lack of kilts doesn’t rule out Scotland but maybe suggests a more modern or international guest list.\n\t4.\tVegetation – The leafless vines and somewhat subdued greenery suggest late autumn or early spring in a temperate climate—again consistent with Scotland or Northern England.\n\nPutting it all together, I’m going to narrow my guess down to Scotland—possibly around Edinburgh or the Scottish Borders, where these types of country estates and manor houses are commonly used for weddings and formal events.\n\nAm I warm?",
