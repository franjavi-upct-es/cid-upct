Because the you Tesla drivers own and continue to use the cyber trucks and teslas, your saying that you support Elon Musk and that's why people strike at the vehicle and give you shit. That's the correlation. Please work on your critical thinking and comprehension skills because this is a very basic understanding of why people are doing this.",

Hitler comes into the picture cause VW wanted to be able to produce a car so cheaply that anyone could afford it but realized it just wasn’t possible from a business stand point to essentially build a car for free and sell it for nothing, so Hitler decided to sponsor VW with the nazi party’s official funding to allow VW to produce such cheap cars, hence the people’s car name, as it was a car that anyone could afford. \n\nNow this isn’t to say VW hands were clean during the war.

In spring of 1934, Hitler was made aware of Porsche's car, and personally signed off on development. Hitler then sponsored the production of the facility. Hitler was actually quite involved early on in development, sometimes meeting daily with Porsche. \n\nThere are *very* few things Hitler did for the common good, like a couple max, but VW was definitely one of them.

A factory had survived and the US military had started producing vehicles because they needed them to help rebuild the country, and since the Army isn't in the car-making business, they tried to get Ford and GM and so on to take over, but they refused.  (I learned all this on a programme hosted by James May, so if it's utter bollocks I apologize.)\n\n-\n\nIt was also mentioned that VW started out essentially as an embezzlement scheme.  It was supposed to be a cheap car for the people and workers would buy stamps to put in a book, when the book was full they would turn it in and get a car.  But the Nazi's were using the money that was coming in to build tanks.  VW's were produced, but that was much later down the line after a lot of people got screwed out of their cars.

(2 years after the fact or so)   \n  \nSo I told her later- I don’t like that guy and I’m not going to hang out or around him and that group - for this reason, and a bunch of other shit that got said that night.     \n  \nFast forward like 4 or 5 months and her and I met up for lunch, no longer dating, just trying to say hi and stuff - she goes “so you were right about _____”.  \nI said I know, but what do you mean?  \n  \nShe goes - he hosted a sex party with a bunch of people, there was a bunch of sti testing, there was a consent coach present, it sounded like many of the right steps were taken to make it a safe event right?  \n  \nNope. He (the host, same guy) “stealthed” a girl. For those that aren’t familiar stealthing means to either have a condom on, or say you do, and then either remove it or not put one on but then fuck the girl anyway…. Without her consenting to no condom, and also her believing that there is a condom.  \n  \nIt’s always the people you most suspect. lol, dude was such a fuckin tool of a human being in all aspects she just hadn’t seen it yet and in her defense - he probably kinda hid that side of himself from her and some of the concerning comments I heard from his and his friends were in the men’s bathroom.  \n  \nSo yea, I spot these mother fuckers and then draw hard boundaries and enforce them. I’ve dealt with too many lunatics in my day, both men and women, to let any of these troglodytes disturb my hard earned peace",

Here’s a breakdown of why thorium is seen as a strong contender for the future of nuclear energy:\n\n⸻\n\n1. Safer Reactions\n\t•\tInherently safer designs: Thorium reactors (especially liquid fluoride thorium reactors, or LFTRs) can be designed to shut down passively in an emergency—no meltdown risk like Chernobyl or Fukushima.\n\t•\tNo high-pressure systems: Many thorium reactor designs run at atmospheric pressure, which reduces explosion risks.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Less Nuclear Waste\n\t•\tProduces less long-lived radioactive waste: Thorium produces waste that remains radioactive for hundreds of years instead of tens of thousands.\n\t•\tMinimal plutonium production: Makes it harder to divert material for nuclear weapons.\n\n⸻\n\n3. More Fuel Efficient\n\t•\tHigher energy yield: A ton of thorium can produce as much energy as 200 tons of uranium or 3.5 million tons of coal.\n\t•\tAbundant and cheap: Thorium is about 3–4 times more abundant in the Earth’s crust than uranium and often found as a byproduct of rare earth mining.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Proliferation Resistant\n\t•\tHarder to weaponize: The fuel cycle doesn’t easily produce weapons-grade material, which helps reduce nuclear proliferation risks.\n\n⸻\n\n5. Better Sustainability\n\t•\tClosed fuel cycle potential: Thorium reactors can potentially consume their own waste or even burn existing nuclear waste.",

The radiolytic gas buildup alone is an environmental hazard the likes of which make any waste facility a powderkeg.

In fact as part of the cycle, the fuel in the reactor could be made to produce weapons grade uranium-233 which is bred in a thorium reactor:\n\n> As a potential weapon material, pure uranium-233 is more similar to plutonium-239 than uranium-235 in terms of source (bred vs natural), half-life and critical mass (both 4–5 kg in beryllium-reflected sphere).[8] Unlike reactor-bred plutonium, it has a very low spontaneous fission rate, which combined with its low critical mass made it initially attractive for compact gun-type weapons, such as small-diameter artillery shells.[9]\n\n> A declassified 1966 memo from the US nuclear program stated that uranium-233 has been shown to be highly satisfactory as a weapons material, though it was only superior to plutonium in rare circumstances. It was claimed that if the existing weapons were based on uranium-233 instead of plutonium-239, Livermore would not be interested in switching to plutonium.[10]\n\n\n\nMore importantly, at the time the United Stated ceased thorium development, the state had more than enough weapons grade plutonium. Radioactive molten salt is just a difficult substance to work with. This Chinese reactor is not a full-time thorium reactor, and they are building mostly pressurised reactors common in the United States.\n\nHere is a podcast on molten salt reactors:\n\n",

                "comment": "All jokes below aside, here's some info about the 233Pa problem (those who know better than me feel free to correct me here in case I miss something):\n\nNuclear reactors are filled with fuel, normally 238U, that turns into the *actual* fuel inside the reactor before being used. So normally 238U becomes 239Pu, and now we have our fuel. Just like 232Th turns into 233U, which is the actual fuel here.\n\nThe problem here is the intermediary step: 238U -> 239Np -> 239Pu, or in the Thorium case, 232Th -> 233Pa -> 233U.\n\nWhat's the problem again? Well, 239Np has a half-life of about two days, who cares. 233Pa though has a half-life of 27 days. Way more time to absorb a neutron (or more) and turn into whatever else you definitely don't want too much of inside your reactor.\n\nSo to use your fuel as fuel and not something else that makes your reaction harder to control, you would have to put 232Th into your reactor, wait for it to turn into 233Pa, filter that out, wait for it to decay outside the reactor, then put the newly generated 233U in as the actual fuel. Oh, and ideally you want to have a continuous process, so you need a filtration system. That's why you want to keep the stuff molten, it's a bit easier to filter a liquid than rocks.\n\nBut here's the thing: 233Pa radiates gamma rays at ~769 TBq per gram. Stand next to one gram of 233Pa for one hour and you get a 20 Sv dose and hopefully die fast enough to not be in pain for too long. Ah well, I won't stand next to it, right? Wrong. That amount of radiation does a number on the filtering equipment, so you'll have to send someone in there for maintenance. And that means getting rid of even the tiniest amount of 233Pa first, or your workers will reach their yearly dose limit FAST. Or die.\n\nAnd that's just physical basics you can't change by throwing more money at. Engineering is an entirely new question here.\n\nEDIT: Should have pointed out that I'm talking about breeders here, since that's what a thorium reactor is. \"Classic\" nuclear reactors, as pointed out by /u/MRH2, use 235U as fuel. The whole point of a breeder reactor is that it can use fuel that is easier to come by. CANDU, also mentioned below, is a different reactor type again that uses heavy water as a moderator and can also use natural 238U, among other cheap stuff, as fuel.",

                "comment": "[Original post with links.](\n\n\nwarning, nuclear physicist talking.\nAnything you watch or read when they talk about Thorium, do the Protactinium test: Ctrl+F \"Protactinium\".\nIf you've heard about Thorium, you might remember that 232Th is not a nuclear fuel per se, it must be turn into the good stuff 233U; thats the one that will fission and give you your energy from fission, to turn into heat, steam, etc. Think of it like a recipe, you have butter and flower, you mix them to get the shortbread that you want. See how easy it is for everybody to get some shortbread?\nExcept everybody also like to gloss over that between the \"butter/flower\" step and the \"shortbread\" step, there's a \"white phosphorous neurotoxic napalm\" step that might make things a bit more complicated the kitchen. That's your 233Pa.\nSo it goes 232Th+n -> 233Pa -> 233U.\nThis is when you say: \"but wait 233c, this is just like 239Pu is produced from 238U: 238U+n -> 239Np -> 239Pu, this is happening all the time in normal nuclear power plants. What's the difference?\". The difference is the same as between 2 and 27.\n239Np (the step between Uranium 238 and Plutonium 239) has a half life of 2 days, while 233Pa (the thing between Thorium and Uranium 233) has one of 27 days. If you leave 239Np in the core it will quickly turn into 239Pu, but you can't leave 233Pa in the core for a month or it will capture more neutrons and turn into something else than 233U. (there's also a matter of cross section: 233Pa has a much higher probability of capturing neutrons than 239Np). If you leave your butter and flower too long in the over you'll get a brick rather than a shortbread.\nIf you want to use Thorium, you must: expose your Th; extract your 233Pu; let it decay into 233U; feed the 233U back to your reactor.\nBy now you should understand why liquifying the fuel make so much more sense for Th than for U. It's not \"MSR work so well with Thorium\", it \"if you want to continuously extract your 233Pa, you'd better do it with a liquid fuel\".\nthis is where you say \"Ok, but still don't see the issue, you just pump and filter your fuel to recover the 233Pa, and let it decay in a tank, and pump/filter the 233U back in for it to fission\".\nI'm going to assume that you know what a Becquerel and a Sievert are.\nRemember the 27 days? with the density of 233Pa, that translates into 769TBq/g (Tera is for 1012 , that's a lot), and because of the high energy gamma from our friend 233Pa, that also means a dose rate at 1m from a 1g teardrop of 233Pa of 20,800mSv/h. Starting to get a picture?\nNotice how all the numbers I've use are not \"engineering limits\" that few millions in R&D can bend, those are hardwired physical constants of Nature: half life, density, neutron capture cross section, gamma energy. Good luck changing those by throwing $ at them.\nNow try to imagine technicians working in those plants, like doing some maintenance, replacing a pump (I haven't even touched the complex chemical separation system you need to extract your 233Pa from your fuel or 233U from your 233Pa, which will definitely need maintenance). Let's put it this way: if there is 1mg of 233Pa left in the component they are working on, they'll reach their annual dose limit in 1h.\nNow try to imagine the operating company of those plant, if you have the tiniest leak, like a tiny poodle, you can't send anybody in for months, meaning you are loosing month of revenue because of a tiny leaky seal failure, what would be a trivial event anywhere else (did I mention that molten salts also have corrosion issues).\nWhen they say \"Thorium has been used in research MSR\", they mean \"we've injected some Thorium and detected 233U\" or maybe even just \"we've injected 233U in the fuel\".\nSo my humble opinion is that playing with it in the lab is one thing, turning it into actual power plants is slightly more problematic.\n\nhere are more numbers trying to imagine an industrial scale Thorium reactor.\n\nTL;DR: Thorium will probably never leave the labs to reach industrial, electricity production scale. The physics is sound, the engineering and actual practical operating constrains just kill the concept.",

China was always separate and had many cultures in the far past, and wasn’t it also completely taken over by the Huns replacing their culture? Would all those be considered china? Wouldn’t China as we know be waaaay younger? Obviously still older than a recent country like America, just curious though.",

Importantly, this isn't perceived as \"theft\" from the Chinese perspective as it's all being done for the collective good of the nation and is, thus, a person's *duty* as a Chinese citizen.  China also makes no distinction between government, military, and private citizens and expect ALL to contribute.  This isn't being presented, by the way, with judgement, malice, or editorializing but as a simple statement of facts.  It is important context, in my opinion, for understanding the US's place on the global stage.",

The molecules become gas, which builds up and up and up as more and more molecules break down over years, which subsequently builds pressure in the containers bit by bit, until...*boom.*\n\nThe US already has a large stockpile of Cl/F waste from our MSR experiments in the 50s and 60s, and for those intervening decades *none* of it has been treated since we still don't have a waste form for immobilization that is able to handle all the different types that exist which lasts for a long, long time.\n\nSo China just going head first into developing these MSRs for the sole dibs of being \"first\" without even considering the fact that *they will have no way to treat it and will basically cause buildups of explosive nuclear waste to pop up all over their country* is, unsurprisingly, about on par for what I'd expect of them considering how they've approached other research areas.

The Mongolians completely took over China, forming the Yuan dynasty (the Huns did not, they were defeated). The Manchurians also took over China, forming the Qing dynasty so you are correct in that. But it only proves the point stronger that 'Chinese' culture is quite robust, that the culture is still intact after not one but two foreign takeovers. For example, Kublai Khan was an emperor of Mongolian descent, but referred to himself as emperor of China, and Han Chinese culture was the vast, vast majority throughout the Yuan dynasty. Same with Manchurians, notice there is no country called Manchuria? Manchurians are primarily now a ethnic minority in northern China, and again in the Qing dynasty, Han Chinese culture was the dominant culture by far. A way to put it would be that China has had many governments (dynasties) over the years, some of them even foreign governments, but the central culture has never changed or switched since the beginning (wherever you put the 'beginning' as).",

The following information is derived from the Environmental Impact Assessment Report of the 10 MW Thorium-Based Molten Salt Reactor:\n\nObjective of the Dry Batch Processing Pilot Line.The goal is to establish a 10L-scale dry batch processing research facility to thermally validate the core processes of uranium/thorium separation, carrier salt recovery, and fuel salt reconstitution.\n\nDry Batch Processing Workflow\n\nThe pilot line is designed based on the following fuel salt treatment steps:\n\nSpent fuel salt transfer: Post-reactor fuel salt is transported via a material handling system to a hot cell for temporary storage.\n\nUranium separation: Uranium is extracted via fluorination volatilization or electrodeposition.\n\nCarrier salt recovery: The uranium-depleted fuel salt undergoes reduced-pressure distillation to recover >90% of the carrier salt.\n\nThorium recovery: Residual salt after carrier salt removal is processed in a molten salt electrolyzer to recover thorium via cathodic electrodeposition.\n\nFuel salt reconstitution: Recovered uranium, thorium, and carrier salt are reductively blended with pure additives to reconstitute reactor-ready fuel salt.\n\nHigh-level waste treatment: High-activity waste from processing is immobilized using iron phosphate-based glass-ceramic solidification technology.\n\nBased on the above process flow, the construction of the dry batch process test line mainly includes fuel salt reception and temporary storage, fluoride volatilization, decompression distillation, molten salt electrolytic deposition, fuel salt reconstruction, HLW salt treatment, tail gas treatment and other units.\n\nAfter the completion of the system, the batch processing capacity of NaF-BeF2-ZrF4-UF4-ThF4 fuel salt will be 10L, the total recovery rate of uranium and thorium will be >85%, the recovery rate of carrier salt will be >90%, the decontamination coefficient of the fission products will be >100, and the reconstructed fuel salt will meet the requirements for the use of the reactor.",

This is why countries investing heavily in solar and wind also have extremely high reliance on gas; only gas plants are able to spin up quickly enough to load follow.  But those plants have to be maintained and staffed even when generating minimal energy on standby, further adding to the costs incurred by renewables.\n\nNuclear is, has been, and for the foreseeable future will continue to be the only true sustainable energy solution.  Here too the LCOE numbers are misleading, as nuclear's cost is wildly inflated by incompetent regulations born out of either a misunderstanding of the threat radiation represents, or deliberate activism intended to murder it carried out by NIMBYs and environmentalists.  The true cost of nuclear energy could drop by an order of magnitude if we addressed how we fund it and tossed out the godawful LNT nonsense and did a proper cost-benefit analysis of risks and regulations.\n\nRenewables are useful and have a place, but not pursuing nuclear heavily for the last fifty years is easily one of the biggest mistakes America has ever made.",

If anything, nuclear waste is less dangerous than the waste that comes from producing solar cells because the waste from nuclear fission is highly-concentrated and can be easily recycled. The waste from producing solar cells contains a bunch of toxic heavy metals dissolved in waste streams and can be difficult and expensive to clean and reclaim.\n\nIf we get the thorium cycle going then nuclear fission is also fairly close to being limitless, considering how much thorium is available and how much energy it produces. It will probably be enough to bridge to nuclear fusion or better future energy generation technologies so the discussion of \"limitless\" isn't really useful.",

But that novel idea didn't pan out, possibly due to pedestrian safety regulations & driver safety regulations. A structural exoskeleton and crumple zones are mutually exclusive. \n\nNot a bad idea, but when it didn't pan out they did not abandon the project & ended with the worst of both worlds. All the concessions of big flat panels and all the concessions of an aluminum internal frame.\n\nI never cared much about the cybertruck one way or the other & find the obsessive fanboys and obsessive haters equally biased so if a normal person has a better understanding please update.",

And thats a choice someone (Elon) made and their board and designers confirmed as a good choice. \n\nSure US is a big market and a US specific products can be successful but Tesla is not a big OEM and arguably they couldnt afford to make a US specific car. Also not sure who they targeted with this design and specifications so no wonder it doesnt sell.\n\nEither way seems Elmo is a liability for the company.",

The internal communications also show Palantir leadership preparing for a potential backlash from employees or outsiders, with them writing FAQs that can be sent to friends or family that start to ask about Palantir’s work with ICE. \n\n“Hey all, wanted to provide a quick update on our work with ICE,” Akash Jain, the Chief Technology Officer of Palantir Technologies and President of Palantir USG, wrote in a Slack message several days ago. “Over the last few weeks we prototyped a new set of data integrations and workflows with ICE.”",

Palantir began its life as a military contractor working for the CIA and NSA, touting their Big Data approach to providing intel for the U.S. military to aide in uncovering terrorist cells around the world. They were obviously good at it. However, multiple tech journalists at the time questioned and wrote several pieces on the methods used to obtain and manipulate their Big Data, and specifically, how easy it would be for Palantir to fit American citizen’s data into their existing frameworks. Obviously the inner workings of Palantir were speculation from industry experts and whatever insights Karp gave the public, but the danger that Palantir would be used within U.S. borders and on U.S. citizens always remained a prominent plausibility. \n\nPeople knew this would eventually happen, but none of the people in power listened, or cared, and now a tool that was marketed as a way to root out terrorists is being used within our borders and on our citizens. Palantir and its backers and sponsors have been waiting for this exact moment, and they will not squander this opportunity. That you can be sure of.",

                "comment": "From the article: The digital coup unfolding across America's federal agencies just exposed a disturbing international dimension. A whistleblower at the National Labor Relations Board has documented how DOGE's data theft was immediately followed by attempted access from Russian IP addresses – raising grave questions about foreign intelligence penetration of America's most sensitive systems.\n\nDaniel Berulis, an IT professional at the NLRB, provided forensic evidence showing that within minutes after DOGE engineers gained \"God-tier\" access to sensitive labor systems, someone operating from Russia attempted to log in using newly-created DOGE credentials. Not just random guessing – they had the correct username and password.\n\nThis wasn't just some random hacking attempt. According to Berulis' official disclosure to Congress: \"Those attempts were 'near real-time'... Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created DOGE accounts — and the person had the correct username and password.\"\n\nWhile these Russian login attempts were blocked, they reveal the immediate vulnerability created by DOGE's activities. The timing suggests either shocking carelessness or something far more sinister – coordination with foreign intelligence services.\n\nCybersecurity experts who reviewed Berulis' evidence saw techniques consistent with sophisticated Russian intelligence operations. Former FBI cyber official Russ Handorf noted these actions match what we've seen from Russian threat actors targeting U.S. government systems in the past. The key difference? \"They were given the keys to the front door.\"\n\nThis Russian connection is especially alarming given Elon Musk's well-documented ties to Putin and Russian oligarchs. His companies have received significant Russian investment, including from sanctioned billionaires. The whistleblower's attorney specifically noted the foreign intelligence dimension, stating: \"This case has been particularly sensitive as it involves the possibility of sophisticated foreign intelligence gaining access to sensitive government systems.\"",

Techniques like NAT (Network Address Translation) allow multiple devices to share a single public IP address, making it difficult to trace traffic back to an individual device. Tools like VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) encrypt a user’s internet traffic and route it through a remote server, effectively hiding the user’s real IP address and replacing it with the VPN server’s IP. Proxy servers function similarly by acting as intermediaries, making it appear as though traffic is coming from the proxy rather than the original source. Tor (The Onion Router) takes this a step further by routing traffic through multiple volunteer-run servers across the globe, adding layers of encryption to enhance anonymity. In more malicious contexts, attackers can perform IP spoofing, manually forging packet headers to make traffic appear as though it originates from a trusted IP. These methods highlight why IP addresses should not be solely relied upon for identifying the true origin of network activity.  Pivots and indirect attacks can make an attacker appear from anywhere on the globe.  It’s a common misconception that you can trace an IP address.  An IP can be traced to Russia but it could be your neighbor in Ohio infiltrating your network.",

And no audits. Only Social Security and Medicaid which you can't escape those anyway.\n\nSo it's easy decision to have someone knowledge on your side and backs you up if the IRS comes knocking. That piece of mind is priceless.\n\nSometimes cheaper or free isn't better and I've used the free filing service once and it didn't help me much at all to get me as many deductions I was eligible for. I just paid the $800 I owed because I sent it off to them and then swore off the free service after that and saved considerable more with a paid tax service.\n\nSo I'm kinda glad they are eliminating the free service, it was a rip off for many.",

If you have nothing to claim, just skim to the end and hit submit as a confirmation your income etc. is accurate.\n\nSome people decide to go to local accountants to submit it for them if they want to maximise their deductions, but if you have some idea it’s completely unnecessary. Let alone any of those big firms they have in the US whose business model it is. The idea of filing taxes being anything more than a blip of effort feels like a foreign concept.",

Of course cryptocurrency has no inherent value, but it seems like using it as a repository of data like some sort of decentralized server with multiple backups, would give people a 'reason' to use the blockchain in addition to the potential money the currency could make in speculation.\n\nSo it seems to be a solution that could be entertained, but I was wonder if there was some obvious downside besides perhaps a break in the chain somewhere, which it would seem to me like a smart algorithm could make it all but an impossibility as long as the internet is functioning and enough people are using the network. I guess the sheer amount of data you said could be a problem, but there are a ton of hard drives connected to the internet not being utilized that would easily give the required space.\n\nI was just shooting the shit because it makes sense to me so far with my limited knowledge of the inner workings of it.",

But in reality almost all that stuff is still protected by the first amendment, and X and Meta will have no problem defending lawsuits. \n\nDefamation is a different beast though. Its not protected by the first amendment and it’s very difficult to tell when something is defamatory or not (it takes courts months to figure out if something was defamatory, you think a minimum wage moderator at Meta can do it accurately on thousands of posts/day?), so the sites will have to just remove anything with a remote possibility it could be defamatory.

Basically anything with a community note will be an individual lawsuit. \n\nThe article states: “Republicans argue the statute gives social media protection if a person, group or organization claims censorship of certain political views” but that’s only if the censorship is one sided. Reddit does not have to host political content at all if section 230 is removed. They could fairly ban all political content and it wouldn’t be “unfair censorship”. \n\nOnce again it feels like they are moving fast and breaking things they don’t understand in order to get a short term win.",

Even most eurofighter operators have some f35s. \n\nThe US has the f22 as well, but it was never for sale.\n\nPretry much every f35 partner is stuck scratching our heads wondering what the fuck we do now. Developing our own 5th Gen fighter could easily take a decade and 50 to 100 billion dollars before the first one flies. A 6th Gen fighter, if we are lucky is probably the same price range( but more on the high end) and 20 years away to fly anything worth mentioning\n\nSo do we keep buying f35s and hope the US goes back to sane in 2026/2028, or so and then in 2050 and 2060 all this will be forgotten, or do we need a new plan right now?  The f35 is a much better aircraft than the gripen, eurofighter or rafale. The gripen and eurofighter can't carry air launched nuclear weapons, and it isn't clear the French would sell rafale for such purpose, but if we think the US alliance is permanently severed then Canada, Germany, Poland, turkey, South Korea and Japan all need nuclear weapons, and Romania and Greece would be wise to get some as well.  That could be with submarine or land based missiles too, but Canada would be wise to finally take over the Turks and Caicos or base nuclear weapons in both the Bahamas (jointly with the UK of course) and along the US and Russian borders, the Germans, poles, Turks, etc they all want aircraft that's why they have f35s if they can. \n\nSimply ditching the f35 is not easy, and entails major costs and risks, especially if the french, Italians, Turks and Hungarians, or at least some of them go far right. Would you want to find yourself half way through a major project that gets cancelled because of a partner changing sides? Continuing the f35 is also risky if the US tries to abuse control of the supply chain then what?  The US generally probably has the capacity for most of the key components of the f35 without help except for the electronics from Taiwan, and bauxite for aluminium from a number of places. Normally you would refine aluminum in Quebec due to cost, but you could do that in the US and it isn't going to dramatically change the cost of the planes.",

You say it's bad now? They're used to it.\n\nExample, the trains that replaced these are faster and still aren't getting a lot of people out of their cars. The two highways that run parallel still do a huge business. Tech employees who might otherwise take this train end up getting on company buses to go right back on the roads. But it saves them time. The company will even pay the transit fees, but a bus from near your house to your work (and back) is faster than a bus to a train to a bus to your work (and back).\n\nUnfortunately roads represent induced demand. Even if you get people off the roads into these trains then it will make the roads less crowded which induces other people to get into their cars and drive the commute.\n\nMass transit is best used really to make it possible to have more dense areas. Not by removing cars from roads but by removing cars from downtowns. And this kind of Diesel commuter rail is not the best at that. Metros are a lot better.",
