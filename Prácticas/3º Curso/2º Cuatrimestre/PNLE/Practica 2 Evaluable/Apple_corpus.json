Most of the exterior of the device will continue to be aluminum, except with a \"Midnight\" bluish-black finish. Today's Vision Pro is only available in silver.\n\n>The leaker also recently shared a series of images of a new, Lightning-style connector in Midnight purportedly for the next-generation Vision device.\n\n>The Vision Pro uses a similar connector, except with 12 pins instead of eight, suggesting that the new cable is part of a more substantial redesign.\n\n>Apple is expected to release a second-generation Vision Pro headset with the M5 chip between fall 2025 and spring 2026, but the company's work on a lower-cost headset is widely rumored. The latter could be the \"Vision Air\" device Kosutami is today referring to.\n\n>Kosutami has a mixed track record for Apple rumors, but they were the first to say that Apple would replace its leather Modern Buckle band with a FineWoven version in 2023. They also went on to provide the first real-world images of the FineWoven Apple Watch bands prior to their official unveiling, the new Thunderbolt 4 cable released alongside the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 16 Pro's improved thermal design and redesigned battery, and more.",

If Apple already uses a stronger 7‑series aluminium, titanium would **add** weight instead of saving it. In practice, thermal and cost penalties make the trade‑off unattractive unless Apple needs titanium for some other property (e.g., scratch resistance) rather than for mass alone.\n\nonce again, this story doesn’t pass the sniff test\n\n  \nTLDR: 4% potential savings in weight, theres no way they're doing this for weight savings alone",

The alteration seems to be a subtle acknowledgment that ‌Apple Intelligence‌ isn't ready, moving emphasis from ‌Apple Intelligence‌ in the present to support in the future.\n\n*Apple has updated its slogan from “Hello, Apple Intelligence” to “Built for Apple Intelligence” across its entire product lineup. pic.twitter.com/jO3qzbrKT1 — Basic Apple Guy (@BasicAppleGuy) April 15, 2025*\n\nThe change also extends to the iPad and Mac, which also carried the \"Hello, ‌Apple Intelligence‌\" tagline. They too now simply say \"Built for ‌Apple Intelligence‌.\" Meanwhile, some people have noticed a growing number of ‌iPhone 16‌ marketing materials such as billboards with no reference to Apple Intelligence at all.\n\nApple has been hit with multiple class action lawsuits over its delayed Apple Intelligence features. They allege that Apple violated false advertising and unfair competition laws by marketing features that are still not available. Plaintiffs claim they never would have purchased or been willing to pay as much for an ‌iPhone 16‌ had they known that Apple's marketing surrounding the features was false and misleading.",

I heard good things about it and I value slick, simple, well designed desktop interfaces. I'll have to give it a ride in a VM to get up to speed with how it's evolved. But I'll probably stick with MacOS until my hand is forced, which hopefully is many years from now.\n\n-----\n\nOne thing I noted though about replacing the HDD with the SSD I used was that the iMac's fan would get really loud, which, for the longest time, I just assumed it was because of the OS being more taxing on the hardware. But eventually I came to the realization it was because the old HDD had a temperature sensor in it, which no longer existed in the SSD, so the OS was always thinking the drive was overheating. So I installed an app called \"Macs Fan Control\", which let's you manually control the RPM of the HDD fan and it has been perfectly silent ever since. So, just a little pro tip to anyone else who comes across this message while Googling in frustration about having a loud 2011 iMac (and likely other models, I dunno).",

I have a Fold 6 and I like the fingerprint way more than any face ID type of unlock (I have a iPhone 12 for work). I will say, face ID has gotten a lot better with the camera angle, but it still isn't as convenient as the finger print on the power button. Also, paying with google pay feels better too as my thumb is already on the power button from the double press and gives the approval without me having to pull my phone up to my face. \n\n\nAlso, I'm not a picture / video person so the under screen camera is good enough for me on the fold 6, but I will acknowledge that I'm likely in the minority and most people would want a higher quality camera. My wife has the Flip 6 and it works out for her as she can flip the phone around and use the back camera with the outer screen display to see herself.  If the rumors of a Flip style iPhone ever comes true that could be a good solution.\n\nEDIT*\n\nHere's the article where a research firm was able to beat face id with a mask:\n\n\nThere was also a video floating around where a 3d printed mask could partially unlock the phone. There's also numerous accounts of similar looking faces unlocking the phone. It's not full proof and any security firm will tell you that if you need true security, don't rely on these biometrics. \n\n\nHere's the thing, who is going to go through the process of stealing your finger print or creating a mask to get into your phone?  The technology is good enough and anyone intent on stealing your information has much easier ways to do that then to get your finger print or make a whole mask of your face.",

Android has been known to be foiled by photos, but it's impossible with iOS.\n\nAs such, Face ID is *significantly* more secure than Touch ID.

From what I understand being an American company is indeed a part of a problem. As it was mentioned a number of times it is the American companies that will bear most of the brunt of Trump’s tariffs. I don’t mean to be rude, but this is econ 101. I specifically remember studying this in my A-level Economics. Simply put typically the cost of tariffs gets split something like 80/20 with 80% being borne by the importer rather than exporter. Anyway, it would make sense for Apple to become an English company and export to America under 10% tariff as a British product rather than get its logistics to America from China taxed at 145% or whatever or, worse yet, pay for American reindustrialisation. Don’t get me wrong, I am not anti-American in any way shape or form, but honestly Americans are going about deindustrialising their country in a very misguided way",

It's the first time Apple has taken the top spot during the first quarter, capturing 19% of the global market.\n\n>The iPhone maker's success came despite economic uncertainties, with Apple benefiting from the iPhone 16e launch and strong performance in emerging markets. Starting at $599, the iPhone 16e was released by Apple in March to replace the iPhone SE, the most affordable device in the company's lineup.\n\n>Samsung followed in second place with 18% market share, continuing its gradual decline from 21% in Q1 2023. The Korean manufacturer experienced a slow start due to the late launch of its S25 series, but saw sales improve in March.\n\n>Xiaomi kept tight to its growth trajectory to secure third position with 14% of the market, up from 13% a year earlier. The Chinese company's expansion benefited from growth in its domestic market, where its entry into electric vehicles has enhanced its brand presence. Meanwhile, vivo and OPPO rounded out the top five.\n\n>The global smartphone market grew 3% year-over-year in Q1 2025, but Counterpoint has revised its annual forecast and now expects a slight decline for the full year. The adjustment is due to rising economic uncertainties, particularly related to tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n>Counterpoint believes that economic volatility could lead consumers to postpone smartphone purchases, which could potentially disrupt the supply chain and increase trade risks.\n\n>Apple's performance was notably regional in nature. While sales remained flat or declined in the U.S., Europe, and China, the company achieved double-digit growth in Japan, India, Middle East and Africa, and Southeast Asia.",

Swiping on that gave me almost zero errors whereas Apple’s keyboard is like a battle every time I have to use it. The keyboard is possibly the worst part of the iPhone experience, and that’s *after* they’ve already done a huge pass in an effort to improve it. If I have to sacrifice a little bit of privacy to make it usable I’ll do it. I don’t care anymore. \n\n2* I started instinctively using Gemini. It was instantly useful to me, and felt completely natural, and going back to Siri now feels like going back in time. I’m not really a fan of AI, but let’s be honest, the internet has become a nightmare to use in general, and it was incredibly satisfying to just ask Gemini whenever I was feeling curious, and instantly bypass all the bullshit. If Apple don’t get their AI ducks in a row I can definitely see a future where they blockbuster themselves.",

Emails always feels more \"secure\" and the \"proper way to do important business\" even if that has changed.",

        "description": "Last Monday, my app Griply became [App of the Day in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/story/id1800487134) and honestly, it still feels surreal.\n\nI’ve been designing iOS apps since the days of skeuomorphism - iOS 6 was where it all started for me. Ever since, I’ve been fascinated by the idea of building tools that don’t just look great, but *actually help people live better lives*.\n\nBut when it came to working on my own goals, nothing really worked. I had long-term goals in one place, habits in another, and daily tasks in a third - and no real sense of how it all connected. It felt unnecessarily complex. I wanted one tool that brought it all together.\n\nSo I started sketching. And teamed up with two others I met at an app agency in Utrecht (the Netherlands). Later a fourth joined to help us bring it to more platforms.\n\n**The journey**\n\nWe started Griply in 2021 as a side project (nights, weekends, whenever we could). For a long time it was slow, steady progress.\n\nThen a little over a year ago, we quit our jobs and went all in. We’re fully bootstrapped, so no funding, no safety net - just the belief that if we kept listening to users and improving the product, it would start to resonate.\n\nSince December, things have really started picking up. Steady growth, strong retention, and amazing feedback from users who finally feel like they’ve found the system that works for them.\n\nAnd last Monday, Griply became App of the Day in the UK and Ireland App Stores.\n\nSeeing it featured by Apple was one of those moments you dream about when you start something like this.\n\n**What Griply does**\n\nGriply connects your goals, habits, and daily tasks in one place - so you can make real progress toward what matters, not just tick off tasks.\n\n* Break goals into subgoals, habits and tasks\n* Make goals measurable (e.g. km, books, weight, $)\n* Track visual progress with clean charts\n* Plan your day with everything goal-connected\n* Plan your goals on a yearly or 5–10 year roadmap\n* Use widgets to not lose sight of goals, tasks, or habits\n* Works across iOS, Mac, Web & Windows\n\nWe ship updates (almost) every week and nearly every feature we’ve added came from real user feedback.\n\n**🎁 To celebrate the App of the Day feature, I’m doing a small giveaway:**\n\n1. **First 25 replies: Lifetime Premium**\n2. **Next 25: 1 year Premium**\n3. **Next 50: 6 months Premium**\n4. **Everyone else: 1 month Premium**\n\n**Just reply and send me a DM with the email you used to sign up. I’ll unlock premium access manually.**\n\n📱 Download the app here: [https://apps.apple.com/app/id1556692747](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1556692747) \n\nWe’re still a small, self-funded team of four, building this with a lot of passion.\n\nIf you enjoy discovering indie apps - or have thoughts on how we could make Griply better - I’d love to hear from you.\n\nAnd if you decide to support us with a rating or review, it would honestly mean the world.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n**EDIT: Wow, thank you all for the support - it really means a lot!**\n\n**Answered everyone in my DM's so far. Still giving away a free month.** **Just send me a DM with your sign up email address :)**",

Besides a big effort to make the design of Apple’s operating systems more consistent, a big theme of the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference is likely to be iPad software.\n\nI’m told that this year’s upgrade will focus on productivity, multitasking and app window management — with an eye on the device operating more like a Mac. It’s been a long time coming, with iPad power users pleading with Apple to make the tablet more powerful.\n\nMany of them, including myself, just wanted Apple to put macOS on the iPad. They won’t get their wish, but the changes will likely go far enough to make a lot of those users happy — at least for now.\n\nThe revamp is arriving about a year after Apple brought the M4 chip to the iPad Pro, which, in my experience, seriously makes the device fly. The software also is coming around the time new iPad Pros with M5 chips are likely to be ready. For years, users have said that it feels like the hardware capabilities of the iPad are well ahead of its software. That could soon be changing.”",

        "description": "Hey folks!\n\nI’m a solo indie dev making [Substage](https://substage.app), a command bar that sits neatly below Finder windows and lets you interact with your files using natural language.\n\nDuring my day job I’m a game developer, I’ve found it super useful for converting videos and images, checking metadata, and more. Although I’m a coder, I consider myself “semi-technical”! I’ll avoid using the command line whenever I can 😅 So although I understand that there’s a lot of power beyond the command line, I can never remember the exact command line arguments for just about anything.\n\nI love the workflow of being able to just select a bunch of files, and tell Substage what I want to do with them - convert them, compress them, introspect them etc. You can also do stuff that doesn’t relate to specific files such as calculations, web requests etc too.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. First, it converts your prompt into a Terminal command using an LLM (OpenAI etc, or using local integration with LM Studio / Ollama)\n2. If a command is potentially risky, it’ll ask for confirmation first before running it.\n3. After running, it runs the output back through an LLM to summarise it\n\nI’d love to hear any feedback on any aspect of the app, thanks! Website is: [substage.app](http://substage.app)\n\n(Edit: if you saw this twice, apologies! I posted original with wrong flair and less clear title, which I have now deleted)",

        "description": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m Ayo, a self-taught developer for Android and iOS. I created a productivity app for Android years ago which I’m excited to finally bring to iOS and Mac!\n\nI know — another productivity app, right? But hear me out.\n\n4.Do is a task manager built around the Eisenhower Matrix. It helps you focus on what actually matters by dividing tasks into four simple categories: important, urgent, both, or neither. If your to-do list constantly feels overwhelming, this method can help you zero in on what truly moves the needle. This is useful for everyone but can be especially useful for people with ADHD like me.\n\nWhile I’m not the first to use this idea, I’ve aimed to make it as intuitive and visually clean as possible—something you’ll actually want to use daily.\n\n**Features:**\n\n4.Do has been built natively for iOS and MacOS to make full use of each platforms strengths and size advantages including but not limited to a lot of what you would expect from a task app: Reminder notifications, subtasks, attachments, repetition, tags/filters, iCloud sync.\n\nPlus\n\n\\- Quadrant and regular list view (Calendar and Kanban views planned)\n\n\\- Quadrant customizations\n\n\\- Drag and drop between quadrant\n\n\\- Lots of widgets\n\n\\- Control center widgets\n\n\\- Menu bar app (Mac only)\n\n\\- Sticky floating windows (Mac only)\n\n\\- Siri Shortcuts\n\n\\- Task heatmap and completion distribution charts\n\n**Price:**\n\n4.Do is free to download with most of its features being free and advanced features and customizations being paid. Most users will probably find the free features more than enough though.\n\n**Privacy**\n\nThe only information I collect is anonymized crash data to help find and fix bugs. I have zero interest in who you are or your data.\n\n**Promo Codes:**\n\nI have 50 Promo codes to give away, if interested, drop a comment requesting one down below and I'll DM you a code. To redeem the promo code Go to App Store > Account > Redeem Gift Card or Code.\n\n**Link:**\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/4-do-task-list-manager/id6443960155](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/4-do-task-list-manager/id6443960155)",

The industry wants apple to start making a folding / flip phone so that their bets seem justified and there will be a massive push in that particular segment.  \n\n  \nIn the laptop space apple is killing it with M series chips. They have successfully managed to get out of the intel rut. iPad series is probably the most confusing it has ever been with the recent launch of iPad 11th gen series.\n\n  \nCan say the same thing about the phones, I mean they are trying to launch a \"budget\" phone with mini / e / air series but then again that's not exactly \"innovation\" per se. \n\nThey have launched a few good products with the recent beats launches - which is pretty interesting on the Android front.   \n  \nIf you take every single part of Apple separately - each of them is probably a billion dollar business, which is probably a testament to how much they have grown in the past 25 years - considering they were on the verge of bankruptcy in 99.   \n\n\nThey need to push more on software side and develop that side of the business mainly Siri, and its functionality. But that's about it. \n\n  \nThey have several good products - that we know about. They have several products we don't about that may or may not be in development. \n\n  \nUnless there is some radical innovation somewhere - or something out of blue, Apple has earned the right to coast for a while.",

Even going back to the iPod, that was made possible because Apple locked down the supply chain of Toshiba 1.5' HDDs that nobody wanted and were intended for laptops. Being able to fit that many songs in a device wasn't because Jony Ive is good at using CAD.\n\nEvery big product has a similar story. The Macbook Air came out of them being able to ask for a special chip from Intel because, while Windows PC were a much larger market in total, Apple were the largest individual customer and had enough of a market to get specific R&D that, I dunno, ASUS would not be able to get. \n\nThere is what companies *say,* and then there is what they *do*. Apple used to make shit computers, then they got a decent supply chain guy, and they made good computers. Apple used to make shit mobile devices, then they got a decent supply chain guy and they made good mobile devices. \n\nApple's weak link is that most of the innovation in tech in the last 10 years has been away from products completely and towards cloud infrastructure and services leveraging that infrastructure. It doesn't matter if the product guy or the supply chain guy is running the show if there future isn't in products.",

So they market this incompetence as a \"feature\". But how do we know it's a sham? Because Edward Snowden gave us the documents to prove Apple does in fact invade everyone's privacy - just like everyone else.\n\nBut privacy isn't the real problem. They can't develop AI because that requires massive amounts of data processing. Apple has lacked that infrastructure since inception, they simply can't do it. \n\nSo what? Not every company can do everything. In the past they relied on partnerships to accomplish what they couldn't like making displays, heart rate monitors, etc. But AI requires * input * from Apple's data collection to render results, inputs they don't have a mechanism to process.\n\nThey also have zero second mover advantage with this partnership approach. ChatGPT is available to everyone with zero exclusive Apple features. \n\nThis lack of meaningful progress on any front, piss poor launch decisions like the Apple Vision and the disaster known as Apple Intelligence were brewing the perfect storm to tear Apple a new one.

They’ve had a few high-profile failures recently, especially on the software side, but the only reason that’s really even notable is because of how rare it is for Apple specifically. Other companies have failures and delays with much greater frequency. It’s just part of product development. I’m not trying to excuse the failures but I don’t think they’re near prevalent enough yet to question the fundamentals of the company. Don’t forget they shipped their own cellular modem just a few months ago that is actually on par with if not better than Qualcomm in its first generation. People really underestimate how major that one in particular is I think. ",

I remember learning in business school that the only reason Apple wasn't becoming like the cash cows of Microsoft, IBM etc was because Apple kept re-upping their cycles with new market changing products, iPod, iPod shuffle, iPhones, iPads, Macbook Air etc etc. \n\nScott Forstall (a name only some of the older heads here might remember) was set to take over Apple, he was very similar to jobs with creative work and innovation. When Jobs passed the board overlooked Forstall and picked Tim Cook. Cook fired Forstall for a pedantic reason, not apologizing for how poorly apple maps flopped. Cook isn't an innovator, but he was a genius at supply chain. He was great at maximizing the value of supplies and parts which is what the board wanted to squeeze every dollar out of the stock price for Apple. This is why after Jobs passed, every iPhone a year after was the same chassis design and reused old parts from previous years. Jobs didn't care about waste or completely redesigning the device each year while Cook prefers to reuse everything from years ago to maximize value out of old inventory. \n\nApple went from an innovation leading company to a company that copies Androids tech from 6 years prior.",

The reason the iPhone worked isn’t simply because those guys were visionaries, it’s because the tech had evolved to a point where that product was possible in the first place. Other companies were beginning to make iPhone-ish devices too. The iPhone was possible because we had fast enough processors that were energy efficient enough to run on mobile, batteries that could be small yet powerful enough, cheap enough solid state storage, cellular networks that could support data, development of multitouch, and so on. It was a unique confluence of technology almost all at once.\n\nSince then, most tech components have evolved off of those things, rather than being big enough to contribute to some other revolutionary platform. What else is there? A TV set is too banal; a home hub is too passive; a car is too complex; headsets are too annoying; AI is a solution in search of a problem. Personally, I think the next revolutionary leap will be something more like holograms or projections as a platform, if that is even technologically possible. Everything between that and what we have now will inevitably be iterative.",

If you look at the state of the market at the time, *nobody else* was thinking of building a touch screen phone in the way Apple was. Everyone was convinced smartphones were this low powered, low res screens, PDAs with mobile connectivity which required a keyboard and stylus to use properly.\n\nEven the iPhone-ish devices like LG Prada had a built in keyboard and its operating system was a terrible, stuttering, Flash based OS that looked more like a dumbphone OS than a true next gen OS. What the iPhone brought to the table was a fully fleshed OS based on a *desktop operating system* with desktop-class web browsing and apps. The development environment (once the SDK came out in 2008) blew away everyone else on the market at the time with their crappy Java applets, and allowed Mac developers to use their Objective-C and Cocoa skills to make great iPhone apps. Nobody else had things like Core Animation, Core Data, a powerful UI toolkit like Cocoa Touch, etc. iOS itself was based on Mac OS, that was huge! Nobody else did it that way before.\n\nEven if the technologies were there, Apple was the only one who managed to put them together in a way that made sense, revolutionised the market and made everyone else follow in iPhone's footsteps, and left competitors in the dust for \\~5-10 years until they managed to create truly competitive products and not just cheap iPhone knockoffs.\n\nWhen the iPhone came out the reactions were:\n\n* \"We sell billions of phones, we'll be fine\" - Nokia\n* \"The computer guys aren't going to figure out how to make a smartphone, what they've show on stage must be a trick\" - BlackBerry\n* \"$500? That's the most expensive phone and doesn't even have a keyboard, plus no business support\" - Microsoft\n* \"Crap, we gotta start over with our UI\" - Google because they were building a BlackBerry clone at the time\n* \"Crap we need a new OS ASAP\" - Palm\n\nThese are not the reactions of an industry that was ready to bring out what Apple did with the iPhone.",

However, just comparing his leadership (and who he promotes/hires/culture/etc), and look back at the pre-iPhone R&D:  \nOther companies were working on full touchscreen phones already. But they were working with established touchscreen technologies, and screen technology, which was affordable but had limitations, kind of like the chin bezel we saw for a long time.  \nSteve not only focused on hiring creatives, but when they showed him options he knew the value in usability. And I think that’s how Apple went with Capacitive screens, refined their multitouch to be accurate, with natural motion and elasticity. And they went thru countless hardware designs until they found a way to engineer an equal size bezel for the screen.  \n  \nI’m not saying for certain that Tim Cook would make different decisions in that scenario, but it certainly seems to me he has a lower bar for “acceptable usability” to release something, and so I think details like that could easily get missed if it were very expensive.  \nAnd as a whole, I do not feel like Tim or even some of the other Apple Execs, really use the whole suite of their products in day-to-day; like I can’t imagine their top 5 execs have regularly been using Siri,  Reminders app, Calendar, iOS Mail, THEMSELVES on the daily. There’s just too many longstanding issues that a creative would say “hey can this work better? Less clicks, more view options, better snooze, richer notifications, etc?”.  \nI don’t doubt their assistant fills out a calendar for them, and they probably use Mac Mail app, but not the mobile stuff and not the DETAILS.  \n  \nI hope that makes sense; it’s not that their top people are doing a terrible job, it’s that there is often not a clear vision of refinement AND  innovation, at the same time.  \n  \nThere are plenty of exceptions BOTH ways here: Steve released some products he knew were half baked, and just plain bad.

Because of Cook's expertise but also because throwing a new CEO into this house on fire having to move manufacturing to new countries and having to deal with Trump and the whole nightmare would not be a good way for a new leader for Apple to start. It could be some bad years for Apple coming up financially due to no fault of the new CEO.\n\nI'd love for Ternus to be the future leader of Apple but I wouldn't wish dealing with this economic/logistics situation and handling Trump on Ternus.\n\nCook should probably continue through any major upheavals in Apple's worldwide manufacturing supply chain and through the end of the Trump term. Provided there is stability to be found then... but that is also uncertain. \n\nThis situation with the world economy now and Trump demonstrates how tricky it is to find someone who is best to handle all things as CEO of Apple as such a massive worldwide entity. It's hard to find someone who can be the visionary product CEO, while also managing the huge logistics of the business, while also being basically like a head of state doing global politics.",

The excitement mostly came from technologies appearing in the consumer space for the very first time at Apple keynotes. There’s enough focus on tech innovation in categories like smartphones and tablets etc. now, that Apple is going to find it nearly impossible to do that again. Competitors have the advantage of much lower scale. Technologies become viable for small Android brands sooner than they do for Apple because of this. You’re just not going to see Apple do something you’ve never seen before again, at least not in existing product categories. The Vision Pro is an example of the kind of thing that can still recapture that excitement, but it failed to do so mostly because it was so expensive. That’s the only way Apple can really be a leader in innovation again, though - do it so early that it has to be very expensive, and by extension low volume. The new Apple is about doing things successfully at massive scale, not for the first time. But that also means we’re going to naturally interpret everything they do as “safer” and more boring. ",

There were mp3 players and smartphones before Apple’s big hits, but they sucked and were hard to use for the layperson. He had the balls to push back against wireless carrier insertion in the product-line, that was his great early innovation with the iPhone. \n\nThe fact that Ternus is already a Senior VP of much of their device hardware shows that Apple indeed employs people who have vision and understand Apple’s place in the tech industry. \n\nI guess my problem is that I don’t really see what Apple is missing that they’re in desperate need of a visionary CEO.",

We don't have 'The Apple' services, and since it's been 8 years I don't think it goes under warranty anymore for the butterfly, so anyway, I was wondering how exactly do they fix those — does the whole keyboard gets replaced or they fix/change each individual key? \n\nI've tried finding youtube videos about it and everywhere I see people changing one button at a time, is that the process? So if half the keyboard is faulty, you'd have to manually replace half the switches? Sound expensive.",

Make some \"exclusive\" product that is solely made in USA and see how people react towards buying it. I know for me,. if there was a special sub-page on Apple Store website for \"made in the USA\" stuff. .I would totally browse that. Even if it was just small stuff like T-shirts or Apple Watch bands or Apple coffee mugs or whatever.

I know Apple is working to diversity (Vietnam, India, etc) \n\nMaybe it looks unlike anything we could predict. Maybe it's Apple getting more directly involved with schools and education.

Have you read translations of Hitler's speeches and studied the tactics they used to seize total control?\n\nThe everyday Nazi supporter was not some cartoonishly evil caricature from an Indiana Jones movie. They were normal everyday people. They were the oligarchs of their day, business owners, doctors, teachers, workers, farmers, ect. Most of them wore suits and ties or a working man's uniform. They went to church, they went to work, they played sports and took vacations. They were just normal people. \n\nPrior to the breakout of the war, life would have seemed very normal for your average German. Sure a few people might have disappeared, but they weren't real Germans, and if they were german, they were probably spreading dangerous leftist idology, or they were sexual degenerates. Like Magnus Hirschfeld's trans health clinic in Berlin that was shut down by the Nazis after they burnt all of their research.\n\nIt did not start with a holocaust. Hitler did not run on a platform of mass murder. It was a long series of small steps that led there. Each step only a little worse than the one before it.\n\nThe road to fascism is paved by a thousand people telling you that you are overreacting.",

Chinese manufacturing isn't actually as cheap as it is because the labour costs are cheap - they are not that cheap, comparatively speaking. It's because they have excellent existing supply chains and sprawling logistical networks to drive down costs for everything from raw materials to spare parts to tooling to transportation hubs and bureaucratic apparatus. The view that companies choose to make their things in China simply because they won't have to pay workers as well as elsewhere is outdated. Low(er) labour costs sweeten the deal, but that's not why China is the manufacturing juggernaut that it is. \n\nTake a look at Japan - there are still entire cities (Toyota is literally headquartered and has much of its manufacturing in a city called Toyota) and regions like Aichi that are built around bringing in supplies and churning and transporting out goods as efficiently as possible. It's got several airports, one of the world's largest train terminals, Japan's largest and busiest trading port, a major steel producer, three of Japan's largest machine tool builders, one of Japan's largest rubber and plastic products manufacturers, the world's second largest automotive components supplier, and production facilities of companies like Toyota, Mitsubishi, Suzuki, and Sony.\n\nThere's really nothing close to this level of industrial and logistical networks in the US at this scale and with existing and proven supply chains and labour forces that has excess capacity to replace international exports at any costs, much less an affordable one. To build that up would take years, possibly decades.",

What other countries will be hit with tariffs? Which of those will announce retaliatory tariffs making it hard for Apple to sell their products abroad? There is too much uncertainty in America, and it will likely remain that way for the length of this presidency. So how does a company like Apple solve this problem?

That's concerning. 15/16/17 weren't this bad at this point in their lifecycles.\n\n(And I know I'm inevitably going to get the \"works for me\". Maybe I'm sabotaging myself by using an XR as my beta mule. But given what I've seen + how it has run on the XR + the one-way nature of iOS upgrades, I'm not willing to jump from 17.7.2 on my main device until 18 is in a good place. I'm seriously just over the bugginess at this point. :/ )",

The two reportedly battled over who would spearhead Siri's new capabilities, with both ultimately receiving pieces of the project.\n\nApple Intelligence faced significant delays after internal testing revealed Siri was inaccurate on nearly a third of requests. Apple subsequently admitted that it would take longer than expected to roll out the more personalized ‌Siri‌ experience, and that these features will be rolled out \"in the coming year.\"",

The issue in this instance is that they put a concept that simply doesn’t exist. Do users care about a personal Siri? We don’t know. Remember, the people don’t know what they want until it’s right in front of them. \n\nSmartphones may change in the future. If AI gets good enough to the point that it helps users save significant amounts of the one thing that’s most precious to them - time, then that’s just where the market may shift.

That's why there are \"AI powered\" toothbrushes, washing machines, and yada yada.

They are persuasive to one another; they talk each others language. \n\nTheres a great book titled 'Corporate Lifecycles: How and Why Corporations Grow and Die and What to Do About It'\n\nThe gist is that companies are started by \"founders\" or \"visionaries\" who want to spend 10x money to create 100x value by creating a product that means something and soars the company. And when that product stagnates, and so the company stagnates, and the financials stagnate—they have the creativity to do it again—to create a new product that means something and soars the company—again! And again! And again!\n\nSound familiar?\n\nSteve Jobs. The Apple II. Then NeXTSTEP which became OS X. Then the iMac G3. Then the Mac laptops. Then the iPod. Then the iPhone. Then the iPad.\n\nBut eventually founders get bought out, or run out, or die—and the money people come in and manage those products as long as they can, but if they let it become a money culture where they wear suits and manage by spread sheet—it's only a matter of time. Happens to almost every company, eventually.\n\nCook managed to bypass this issue by realizing his weakness—he's not a visionary—so he leaned on his team to be the visionaries and be the managers of products—while he focuses on his strengths as CEO which is operations. \n\nBut I think this story shows Cook fucked up and fell back on his instincts to care about operations and money over product—he didn't listen to his product guy. And its a taste of what happens when the top guy isn't a product guy. When the rubber meets the road they look down on product guys, don't take them as serious, views them as \"cost.\"",

But now with all the news about Apple being exempt (for now) from the new tariffs, and rumors heating up about the iPhone 17 Pro being a major leap… I’m wondering if I should return it and just tough it out with my 13 Pro until September.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, the 17 Pro could feature:\n\t•\tA full redesign (possibly a horizontal camera bar)\n\t•\tAll 48MP rear cameras + 24MP front camera\n\t•\tA19 Pro chip with 12GB RAM\n\t•\tMore advanced on-device AI features with iOS 18\n\t•\tPossible vapor chamber cooling and bigger battery\n\nI’m still within the return window, and my 13 Pro is holding up fine—not amazing, but fine. My biggest concern is whether the tariff exemption will stick, or if prices could spike by the time the 17 drops (especially since most iPhones are still assembled in China). I’m also a bit tempted by the 16 Pro’s lighter feel and camera bump improvements, but I know I’ll probably get FOMO when the next one hits.\n\nWhat would you do in my shoes? Return the 16 Pro now and wait it out, or keep it and skip the 17? Any insight on how likely prices are to jump later this year would be super helpful.",

The two named plaintiffs said they never would have purchased or been willing to pay as much for an iPhone 16 had they known that Apple's marketing surrounding the features was false and misleading.\n\n>Apple advertised the Siri features in product presentations, on its website, in a TV commercial starring actor Bella Ramsey, and elsewhere.\n\n>Apple was already sued over the delayed Siri features in California last month, and the class action lawsuits could eventually be merged if they proceed.\n\n>A similar complaint was filed against Apple last week in the Canadian province of British Columbia.\n\n>Apple first previewed the personalized Siri features during its WWDC 2024 keynote last June, as part of a wide range of Apple Intelligence features that it said would be rolling out over the course of the following year. That gave Apple until WWDC 2025 this June to roll out the Siri features, but last month the company announced that it needed more time and anticipated rolling out the features at some point \"in the coming year\" from then.\n\n>The features were initially expected to launch in iOS 18.4 last week, but they are now expected to arrive at some point during the iOS 19 cycle. Many well-connected Apple reporters and observers believe the features will not be available until 2026.\n\n>Whenever they launch, the Siri upgrades will include understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. For example, during its WWDC 2024 keynote, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.\n\n>The class action lawsuits in the U.S. and Canada are both seeking damages from Apple, in an amount to be proven at trial, so class members who purchased an iPhone 16 in order to use the personalized Siri features could eventually receive a payout from Apple, if the judges presiding over each case find that the company broke the law.\n\n>Apple's lawyers have yet to respond to any of the lawsuits.",

And that's exactly what we'll do this time.\"\n\n>In 2003, while other companies were still recovering from the collapse of tech stocks, Apple released iTunes. The Nasdaq-100 took more than 15 years to return to its dot-com-era peak. But in the meantime, Apple unveiled the iPhone and the App Store.\n\n>By the time the 2008 recession rolled around, Apple was still selling millions of smartphones and computers. Just two years later, the iPad was released.\n\n>According to the Harvard Business Review, just 9% of companies flourish after an economic slowdown—and like Apple, businesses that make smart investments when the chips are down have a better chance of becoming leaders in their market.\n\n>Apple’s stock had its best day since January 1998 yesterday off the news that President Donald Trump would pause his wide-sweeping tariff plans—which had caused the market to freefall.\n\n>However, it’s unlikely that champagne was being passed around at the company’s Cupertino headquarters, given that the trade war with China is seemingly just getting started.\n\n>Trump’s increase of the tariff on Chinese goods to 125% bodes bad news for the company, which creates a majority of its signature electronic products overseas. According to Wedbush, Apple produces some 90% of iPhones, 75%-80% of iPads, and over 50% of Macs in China.\n\n>Experts tell Fortune that any tariff will likely be passed on directly to consumers, potentially leading to a worst-case scenario where products like the new iPhone 16 balloon to over $2,000—a price tag that most consumers are unlikely to tolerate.\n\n>And while Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint Research, an Apple expert, believes Trump’s tariffs remain a negotiation tactic—if the trade war extends for months, it may become impossible for Apple to take Jobs’s weather-the-storm philosophy.",

It was later that Jobs really got pissed off and decided to show MS and the world how a tablet is supposed to be done!\n\nBut i have also read NYTimes piece on how the iPhone came to be, and in that I read that after buying a small startup that specialised in multitouch interface (an innovation at that time), while testing it out, the people at Apple made a larger screen first, which was essentially a tablet, or the very first iPad. But since tablet as a concept wasn't known to the masses during that time, Jobs decided to debut the multitouch concept in the iPod Touch. After its wild success, they decided that instead of having users carry 2 separate devices with them - the iPod Touch and the mobile phone, what if they just combined the 2? And thus was born the iPhone.",

They want to imagine and emulate it (which has, no fault of Jobs, fucked up my town and industry beyond words). \n\nThey want to imagine that Lee Clow (creative director for Chiat Day and the inventor of the modern brand style we all love to see, Jean Devon (creative director for CKS who actually invented the Apple logo, Jony Ive a freelancer who independently contracted from London for his first decade, or Wosniak as head of his own entire building and team at Apple , and many others were just startup employees at Apple and looked to Jobs to make every decision for them. \n\nJobs was a fantastic suit, and OP’s highlighted story is an example of a businessman telling his shareholders “I’m not laying these people off because I contracted the best in the world- who can find other clients because of their award-winning body of work - and what we will build , though time-intensive will eventually will be great”, and then for him to not wilt and give in when they threaten to fire him and replace with another CEO….That’s something I have yet to personally meet or know in a  businessman ever since, with any ability to see past their greedy noses.

(vast majority choose laptop so this is not nearly as confusing as you are trying to present).\n\nDo you want the cheaper, thinner one for more basic work, or the chunky one that's a bit flashier?\n\nThen, do you want the normal sized one or the big one?\n\nNone of this is especially confusing. It's a decision tree of easily understandable choices, with only two or three options presented at each branch.\n\nIn particular, the Macbook lineup is hardly more complex than it was during Steve Jobs day. Like there's 4 options.\n\nOn the desktop side, they've removed complexity on the iMac side (just one size now) although added another desktop (which most people won't even look at).\n\nFor 'normal' people that might even be confused by the above, they find themselves drawn to the cheapest options very quickly, and don't even need to ponder the differences on Pro-Motion screens, or configure it with higher chips. Once they've chosen a model, they'll go with the base config, and be happy with it.\n\nMost retailers don't even offer the custom configs.  And custom configs existed all through Jobs' tenure.\n\nNow go to Dell's website, or Lenovo's website. It's actually a nightmare trying to work out what the differences are.\n\n\n\nJust looking at laptops only, Lenovo have 7 different *brands*. If I click on Thinkpad (different from a 'Thinkbook' somehow!) I then get a page with 42 results. Each result often has multiple options of sub-model. That's before you even hit the custom configurator. There are hundreds and hundreds of different laptops, before I even hit a custom config selector. When researching the models it was often difficult to find professional reviews, because review sites can't even be bothered to look at them all. This is what a harmful level of complexity actually looks like.",

                "comment": "From the article: A new report from [The Information]( Paywall) today reveals much of the internal turmoil behind Apple Intelligence's revamped version of Siri.\n\nApple apparently weighed up multiple options for the backend of ‌Apple Intelligence‌. One initial idea was to build both small and large language models, dubbed \"Mini Mouse\" and \"Mighty Mouse,\" to run locally on iPhones and in the cloud, respectively. ‌Siri‌'s leadership then decided to go in a different direction and build a single large language model to handle all requests via the cloud, before a series of further technical pivots. The indecision and repeated changes in direction reportedly frustrated engineers and prompted some members of staff to leave Apple.\n\nIn addition to Apple's deeply ingrained stance on privacy, conflicting personalities within Apple contributed to the problems. More than half a dozen former employees who worked in Apple's AI and machine-learning group told The Information that poor leadership is to blame for its problems with execution, citing an overly relaxed culture, as well as a lack of ambition and appetite for taking risks when designing future versions of ‌Siri‌.\n\nApple's AI/ML group has been dubbed \"AIMLess\" internally, while employees are said to refer to ‌Siri‌ as a \"hot potato\" that is continually passed between different teams with no significant improvements. There were also conflicts about higher pay, faster promotions, longer vacations, and shorter days for colleagues in the AI group.",

One of Walker's pet projects was removing the \"hey\" from the \"hey ‌Siri‌\" voice command used to invoke the assistant, which took over two years to achieve. He also shot down an effort from a team of engineers to use LLMs to give ‌Siri‌ more emotional sensitivity so it could detect and give appropriate responses to users in distress.\n\n> The only feature from the WWDC demonstration that was activated on test devices was ‌Apple Intelligence‌'s pulsing, colorful ribbon around the edge of the display. The decision to showcase an artificial demonstration was a major departure from Apple's past behavior, where it would only show features and products at its events that were already working\n\nBlame game etc but Tim Cook should definitely feel the heat for leaving this shitshow unsupervised for 10 years.

It worked perfectly.

It tries to do a web image search. \n\nThose are just a couple examples, but I've noticed it with a lot of stuff.",

                "comment": "Honestly, I know it won't, but I wish this garbage generative code stuff would all just die off. I'm not afraid of technology. I've built ML clusters professionally, I understand how the code works, and I have been connected to applications of real AI in a range of (especially research) contexts.\n\nI just don't want anything I do being used to 'train' anyone's software. A privacy-based framing, which is what Apple offered, doesn't address that. The model may get 'trained' on my work without revealing anything about me to anyone, after all (that's how the generative code firms did it with the rest of their stolen - I mean 'freely available' - data).\n\nAs someone who has purchased from Apple for over three decades, I'd love to still trust them, but I really, *really* don't any more. I wish they would let all of this \"AI\" stuff not merely be opt-out (they defaulted to on with the OS update that pushed Apple Intelligence), but have it be an application that you could uninstall completely. All an opt out ever consists of is a \"trust me\" button. In the past, I was 100% fine trusting Apple. They guarded their reputation.\n\nOnce you declare serial scammer and open enemy of creative people Sam Altman to be your \"partner,\" you own his reputation as your own - even if all you gave him was access to your customers. And I wouldn't trust that con man to water a plant.\n\nAnd yes, I know Apple Intelligence and the OpenAI integration are separate things. But they were announced together, which leads to a logical conclusion that Apple and Altman are of one mind on how the data their code is fed is sourced, how it is used, and who they're ok with it all hurting.\n\nI'm far from alone in giving this kind of feedback to Apple, and so far, they've just told everyone to talk to the hand. It's very weird to me that they'd be willing to lose even a single customer's trust in exchange for being associated with Sam Altman.\n\nSo if this leaves egg on some faces, \\*maybe\\* it'll give them pause and prompt them to take a different approach? And maybe while doing that, they'll cancel their unsavory \"partnership?\" No. Probably not.",

What I’m seeing lately are slackers…who try to cut corners and then have the audacity to say they have the right to be promoted. 😂😂\n\nI’m actually horrified to know this is actually happening at Apple as well.

Just look at Genmoji it heats up my M3 Max and M2 iPad and still takes a while to generate. Yes, it’s cool that it runs on-device, but the experience would be far better with a smart on-device/cloud blend.

This makes more sense now why Siri hasn’t progressed over the past ten years and why Apple missed AI by a mile. They already have a second-to-market delay but this feels way worse. \n\nIs this Tim? Is this the ship he’s steering or is he preoccupied with other things? Either way, the fish rots from the head, and if leadership is failing then Tim needs to fix it, ASAP. Or we could be seeing Apple go the way of IBM.\n\nEdit - added context.",

But this overall lack of being able to deliver polished and finished products is the type of thing that put Apple into financial troubles in the 90s.\n\nYes, Apple is a world-leading tech company. But they're losing their touch for what they became known for: refined and incredibly engineered hardware and software.\n\nSmartphones existed before iPhone, but the iPhone was so well designed it set the standard for the smartphone platform. Same with the iPod--no one made an mp3 player that had an incredibly user friendly design before Apple.\n\nTake the Vision Pro for example--it's a mess. It's slop, even. The hardware is great, I'm sure. But it's not special. It's a Mac strapped to your head with no killer feature. We all know AR/VR, but unlike the iPhone and iPod, it fails to redefine the category of AR/VR headsets. It has no apps, not even media ones like YouTube or Netflix. The fact you have to use Safari to do that is insane-it should have not shipped without those apps being available.\n\nYou could argue, well, the iPhone didn't even ship with an app store. And that's true, but it redefined how you use the web on a phone. It shipped with a full desktop class browser. The iPod had a revolutionary UI for organizing music on a handheld device. AFAIK, there weren't many mp3 players before the iPod that organized the UI the way Apple did.\n\nI was really excited to see if Apple Intelligence Siri could really do all it claimed--they were going to implement it's features in a really imaginative and useful way. But it was nothing more than a concept. Apple should not have advertised a concept video and said they were shipping it. Apple Intelligence was investor-porn, not a real product they could ship.

All the promised stuff with Siri learning from calendars, emails, messages etc, and being context aware will actually make this AI stuff useful, as currently it’s all really just a gimmick that’s failing to deliver. \n\nThe number of times that I’ve tried to ask Siri something and it’s useless and prompts me to tap a button on my phone to allow ChatGPT to handle the request, to then give a mostly useful answer makes me hate the current Siri even more than if it didn’t do it.",

I haven’t used Windows in a professional setting since 2000, and used either FreeBSD or various flavors of Linux as my primary until I switched to Mountain Lion. \n\nAs OP mentioned, and one of the primary reasons I switched from a *NIX desktop to Mac was because “it just works”. I’m all-in on the Apple ecosystem because of the same. Over the last couple of years the number of bugs the OS has shipped with, have gone unfixed for substantial amounts of time, and the number of capabilities that are missing or don’t function as intended just keep growing. I won’t list them ad nauseam; easy enough to google. \n\nMy personal biggest issue is networking. After wake, and at random times networking just fails. I’ve finally landed on a work-around where I have IPV6 turned to link-local only, WiFi is off, and I can just deactivate and reactivate the NIC. If either IPV6 or WiFi are on, networking stops working in the same way randomly, and more often, even if there is no sleep or hibernation. This is a fairly well-known issue and has been reported for at least 3 years. Because I need to keep WiFi off most of the time features like AirDrop and Handoff don’t work. This is just flat out unacceptable in a high-profile OS, and is a single example.",

Cook optimized Apple's supply chain to insane margins with barely modified chassis year to year for the iPhone, while Ive pushed the design way past the form/function line to the point where some MacBooks were nigh unusable.

There’s no Swedish word ”its” or anything like that either, it’s (had to fix it again) just plain dumb.",

But that's because I'm not a fan of the culture that surrounds it. AI is a very expensive and advanced technology yet it has this \"-Bro\" culture around it that cheapens it. The major AI firms focus on it's ability to generate images and video (aka \"slop\") but not it's accuracy. I tried using ChatGPT to generate a summary of a relatively obscure but recent Supreme Court case and it failed entirely. The information was public. ChatGPT \"searches the web,\" supposedly... so why did it fail? That is because AI firms focus on what gets investors and \"-bros\" excited, rather than actually feasible uses for the software. And it makes money, so who cares? \n\nApple's approach to everything has always been \"polish,\" and so Apple's first foray into AI should have been the most polished thing we have ever seen, even if it took another OS release cycle to get there. Obviously Apple can't ignore AI, but they also cannot go down the Microsoft route of just shoving the term \"AI\" everywhere.\n\nThey could have waited a little bit instead of caving to industry pressure. Apple has never been \"the first\" at delivering something, and it's turned them into a monolith. Chasing the shareholder bag is how you become Microsoft, a company that is too big to fail but unable to capture attention in the consumer space outside of Windows.",

I think the *experience* of the Vision Pro was amazing (and that, generally, it's a fantastic piece of tech). But it's not the next iPhone.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that I agreed with the person before me. Tim Cook was able to masterfully execute a *perfect* game plan that created the most valuable company in the world (or at least one of them). And he did that on the seed of the iPhone, a product that spawned many many successors and allowed Tim to flex his particular talents.\n\n(I'm one of those that stretches the argument that the iPhone specifically spawned entire industries, such as Uber and Instagram, which then later influences things like AirBnB and Snapchat \\[and within that argument I'd even be snarky and say that the iPhone spawned Android as we know it\\] but that is a huge opinionated tangent).   \n  \nTim, Apple (inc), the iPhone, etc all occupied a specific piece in the timeline; specifically the iPhone existed before/during the time we were all hyperconnected. I do not think that the Vision Pro can do that, and I am doubtful that Tim can do it either. Maybe Jony Ive comes back, and maybe, just maybe, the Vision Pro is a massive hit, but I don't think those things will happen.\n\nIn summary, I think Tim is great, and I think Vision Pro is cool, but neither of those is a 2010 Tim or 2010 iPhone or a 2010 market and it's going to take not just a new product, but a new product guy to keep pushing this company forward.",

I get a bunch of weird bugs on macos. Icloud features always bug out for me. I constantly get signed out of icloud and then why I sign again it loops me through the enter password window 5 times. It just returns an error 4-6 times then accepts my icloud login. No icloud features work properly for me, I can't get added to an apple home. When I updated to seqouia my cursor speed was reset, when I went to change it showed the speed was still the same, then after another 10 seconds it went back to normal. My computer some how forgot my password once, making me gaslight myself into thinking I somehow forgot my password. I had to reboot into safe mode, re-enter my password there, and some how it worked. I can not explain how insane my computer just not accepting my password is. That's just off the top of my head, I get a lot of random bugs. Windows gives me zero bugs though, all my windows problems I get are hardware related or over clocking related lmao. Every time I have to interact with any apple icloud software it is the most infuriating experience and makes me want to throw my computer at a wall. WHY CAN'T I GET ADDED TO BLOODY APPLE HOME, TELL ME APPLE. It just greys out the option. Any family apple stuff I set up bugs out, gives back useless errors codes, or locks up. It took me like 3 hours trying to set up a a family icloud because the invites just errored out for 3 hours. Anyways that's my rant, apple icloud software sucks ass, and apple macos software has been getting way buggier the last few years. Meanwhile my beloved windows 10 has been perfect. I litterally have never got a single bug from windows 10 in my life. Which I assume is just luck, I am sure there are people who have nightmare experience with windows too.\n\nEdit: actually two more super annoying things. I have a regular issue with mission control failing. It just crashes without giving an errors message and I can't swipe left or right through virtual desktops or go into mission control. I have to force quit the dock or finder iirc to restart mission control. Not the end of the world for me, but I imagine if it happened to other people that would be a huge problem. ALSO mission control keeps rearranging my virtual desktop order, which is INFURIATING. I've never had windows virtual desktops crash or change order on me. How is mission control like ten years old and so buggy.",

Tons of people also didn't wear watches before the Apple Watch, so I don't put much stock into what people do right now. \n\n>I'm not going to start wearing glasses just for that.\n\nApple will still sell products other than glasses, so use those instead. Also, Apple doesn't make products just for you…ask any iPhone mini fan. \n\n>Most people will continue to own a TV/projector, have a large screen on their desk, and use a phone.\n\nThey will, until they don't…just like with smartphones. \n\n>And yet it really isn't.\n\nThat doesn't matter. It was a common opinion as I said. In fact, people were so convinced that they ignored a decade-plus of \"desktop OSes don't work well with touchscreens\" arguments against macOS on the iPad and went straight to Mac apps on the *finger-driven* headset. \n\n>Even if it ran MacOS, it would still be powered by their slowest chip. That's not going to replace all of their Macs for professional use.\n\nNo, a headset does not need to run (only) a regular M-series chip. You can just put a fast processor in a separate box that connects to the headset. Every Apple product that uses something higher than a regular chip is either a desktop or a relatively large laptop, so you're not giving up portability. \n\nAlso, saying that the headset can be a Mac replacement does not imply that the headset can replace every single Mac for every single task (otherwise almost nothing could be a replacement of anything). For example, desktop replacement laptops lack the performance of the highest-end desktops, but are still called replacements. \n\n>Not by anyone intelligent. Do I need to explain how the two aren't similar at all?\n\nLet me explain to you why they are similar. \n\nBoth smartphones and glasses have the potential to replace several existing products with a single device that is as portable as each individual product. \n\nThat's why people thought glasses would be the next smartphone. \n\nYou may respond with a long explanation of differences, but the similarities are what matter in this discussion.",

                "comment": "Summary from [MacRumors](\n\n\nA new report from The Information today reveals much of the internal turmoil behind Apple Intelligence's revamped version of Siri.\n\nApple apparently weighed up multiple options for the backend of ‌Apple Intelligence‌. One initial idea was to build both small and large language models, dubbed \"Mini Mouse\" and \"Mighty Mouse,\" to run locally on iPhones and in the cloud, respectively. ‌Siri‌'s leadership then decided to go in a different direction and build a single large language model to handle all requests via the cloud, before a series of further technical pivots. The indecision and repeated changes in direction reportedly frustrated engineers and prompted some members of staff to leave Apple.\n\nIn addition to Apple's deeply ingrained stance on privacy, conflicting personalities within Apple contributed to the problems. More than half a dozen former employees who worked in Apple's AI and machine-learning group told The Information that poor leadership is to blame for its problems with execution, citing an overly relaxed culture, as well as a lack of ambition and appetite for taking risks when designing future versions of ‌Siri‌.\n\nApple's AI/ML group has been dubbed \"AIMLess\" internally, while employees are said to refer to ‌Siri‌ as a \"hot potato\" that is continually passed between different teams with no significant improvements. There were also conflicts about higher pay, faster promotions, longer vacations, and shorter days for colleagues in the AI group.\n\nApple AI chief John Giannandrea was apparently confident he could fix ‌Siri‌ with the right training data and better web-scraping for answers to general knowledge questions. Senior leaders didn't respond with a sense of urgency to the debut of ChatGPT in 2022; Giannandrea told employees that he didn't believe chatbots like ChatGPT added much value for users.\n\nIn 2023, Apple managers told engineers that they were forbidden from including models from other companies in final Apple products and could only use them to benchmark against their own models, but Apple's own models \"didn't perform nearly as well as OpenAI's technology.\"\n\nMeanwhile, ‌Siri‌ leader Robby Walker focused on \"small wins\" such as reducing wait times for ‌Siri‌ responses. One of Walker's pet projects was removing the \"hey\" from the \"hey ‌Siri‌\" voice command used to invoke the assistant, which took over two years to achieve. He also shot down an effort from a team of engineers to use LLMs to give ‌Siri‌ more emotional sensitivity so it could detect and give appropriate responses to users in distress.\n\nApple started a project codenamed \"Link\" to develop voice commands to control apps and complete tasks for the Vision Pro, with plans to allow users to navigate the web and resize windows with voice alone, as well as support commands from multiple people in a shared virtual space to collaborate. Most of these features were dropped because of the ‌Siri‌ team's inability to achieve them.\n\nThe report claims that the demo of ‌Apple Intelligence‌'s most impressive features at WWDC 2024, such as where ‌Siri‌ accesses a user's emails to find real-time flight data and provides a reminder about lunch plans using messages and plots a route in maps, was effectively fictitious. The demo apparently came as a surprise to members of the ‌Siri‌ team, who had never seen working versions of the capabilities.\n\nThe only feature from the WWDC demonstration that was activated on test devices was ‌Apple Intelligence‌'s pulsing, colorful ribbon around the edge of the display. The decision to showcase an artificial demonstration was a major departure from Apple's past behavior, where it would only show features and products at its events that were already working on test devices and that its marketing team had approved to ensure they could be released on schedule.\n\nSome Apple employees are said to be optimistic that Craig Federighi and Mike Rockwell can turn ‌Siri‌ around. Federighi has apparently instructed ‌Siri‌ engineers to do \"whatever it takes to build the best AI features,\" even if that means using open-source models from other companies in its software products as opposed to Apple's own models.",

                "comment": "> Apple AI chief John Giannandrea was apparently confident he could fix ‌Siri‌ with the right training data and better web-scraping for answers to general knowledge questions. Senior leaders didn't respond with a sense of urgency to the debut of ChatGPT in 2022; Giannandrea told employees that he didn't believe chatbots like ChatGPT added much value for users.\n\nWow... How is this guy even on Apple anymore? He obviously doesn't understand the AI movement and is lost to the past. Siri builds on old technology that is not based on current LLM's. It's basically hard coding queries and answers with limited flexibility. It's a dumb answering machine that takes a manually guided path as it tries to respond. It's actually not \"taught\" anthing. It's not a language model to begin with. So \"better web scraping\" is destined to fail because the pillars are too weak. That's why Siri is so hard to improve. And then he doesn't understand the value of ChatGPT as it provides answer to any question you might have? Sure, it can hallucinate and AI has inherent issues, but not seeing the value? This is now a billion dollar industry.\n\nLet John Giannandrea go. This is inexcusable. A random redditor visiting /r/MachineLearning would be able to see how far off he is.\n\nAnd then, we have this _other_ Siri guy:\n\n> Meanwhile, ‌Siri‌ leader Robby Walker focused on \"small wins\" such as reducing wait times for ‌Siri‌ responses. One of Walker's pet projects was removing the \"hey\" from the \"hey ‌Siri‌\" voice command used to invoke the assistant, which took over two years to achieve. He also shot down an effort from a team of engineers to use LLMs to give ‌Siri‌ more emotional sensitivity so it could detect and give appropriate responses to users in distress.\n\nHe's not much better! Completely misguided focus to work for years in improving responsiveness, when the \"intelligence\" and function itself is abysmal! Who wants a quickly responding idiot? Where is Apple's market analysis on that?\n\nNo wonder we have what we've got when Siri is ran by people who are incompetent, misguided, and not understanding the AI industry.",

                "comment": "How Apple Fumbled Siri’s AI Makeover\n\nLast month, Apple shook up the leadership of Siri and announced an embarrassing delay in new AI-powered features for the assistant. A behind-the-scenes look at the effort shows just how dysfunctional it got.\n\n——\n\nLast June, at Apple’s annual developers conference, the company offered a dazzling demonstration of how artificial intelligence could supercharge Siri, the iPhone’s virtual assistant. But behind the scenes and in the months that followed, the Siri team couldn’t make up its mind about the basic technology needed to make it all work.\n\nOne option they considered was to build small and large language models, which they dubbed Mini Mouse and Mighty Mouse, according to a former Apple employee familiar with the effort. The small model would run on a user’s iPhone and handle simple tasks, such as setting an alarm using Siri. The large model would run in the cloud and perform more-complex chores, like automatically booking an Uber to get an iPhone user to their next meeting.\n\nThen Siri’s leaders decided to go in a different direction and build one large model that could handle everything. That would have required running Siri’s software in the cloud, a reversal of an earlier approach when most of Siri’s software was moved on device for privacy. Other significant technical pivots followed, frustrating Siri staffers and prompting some to leave Apple. That put its goal of releasing the new Siri features this year in jeopardy.\n\n-- The Takeaway\nApple’s decision to delay the release of new AI features in Siri came after the team behind the personal assistant struggled with technical and leadership challenges.\n\nThe indecision was among the factors contributing to Apple’s stunning announcement last month that it was, in fact, delaying the release of the new Siri features until 2026. Inside Apple, the company told staff it was also stripping responsibility for Siri from its AI chief, John Giannandrea, and his lieutenant, Robby Walker, who oversaw day-to-day operations, according to four people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn their place, Apple said its head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, would oversee Siri, with Mike Rockwell, the Apple executive who previously led development of the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, handling Walker’s former responsibilities, according to three of those people. (Bloomberg first reported the changes.)\n\nThe delay was an embarrassing setback for Apple in AI, just nine months after it had reassured investors at its developer conference that it had a plan to get its act together in AI with the Siri upgrades and other features. While Apple has long faced criticism about the plodding pace of innovation in Siri, those concerns have intensified in recent years with the explosion in popularity of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other AI products.\n\nFiguring out how to capitalize on AI could be one of the most consequential challenges Apple, the world’s most valuable company, is now facing—one that could determine whether the iPhone and other Apple products keep their technological edge.",

The demo apparently came as a surprise to members of the ‌Siri‌ team, who had never seen working versions of the capabilities.\n\nI’m so disinterested in the next WWDC. What really cool features are they going to introduce that turn out to be just fancy photoshop and a person recording fake dialogue in a booth? I bought the new iphone partly because I was promised a massive upgrade to Siri - I remember reserving my excitement until I actually got to try the new features, but I had no idea they had no way of actually releasing those features, that they were a complete fabrication.",

                "comment": "Some of Apple’s struggles in AI have stemmed from deeply ingrained company values—for example, its militant stance on user privacy, which has made it difficult for the company to gain access to large quantities of data for training models and to verify whether AI features are working on devices.\n\nBut an equally important factor was the conflicting personalities within Apple, according to multiple people who worked in the AI and software engineering groups. More than half a dozen former Apple employees who worked in the AI and machine-learning group led by Giannandrea—known as AI/ML for short—told The Information that poor leadership is to blame for its problems with execution. They singled out Walker as lacking both ambition and an appetite for taking risks on designing future versions of the voice assistant.\n\nAmong engineers inside Apple, the AI group’s relaxed culture and struggles with execution have even earned it an uncharitable nickname, a play on its initials: AIMLess.\n\nThe dim internal view of the group in many parts of Apple is a stark contrast to that of Apple’s software engineering team, which Federighi has overseen since 2012. It has built up a reputation for efficiency and execution with its work on Apple’s operating systems and messaging, photo, mail and other apps.\n\nFormer Apple employees have referred to Siri as a “hot potato,” continuously passed between different teams, including those led by Apple’s services chief, Eddy Cue, and by Federighi. However, none of these reorganizations led to significant improvements in Siri’s performance.\n\nNow, after seven years, it’s back under Federighi’s oversight, with some former Apple employees saying the change was long overdue, especially given the AI group’s poor track record.\n\nFor example, Federighi’s group also has its own machine-learning team, which has absorbed more AI responsibilities over time, prompting clashes with some of Giannandrea’s teams. The AI team under Federighi is responsible for many of the AI features, grouped under the name Apple Intelligence, successfully released so far.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment.",

                "comment": "— Siri’s Problems\n\nSiri’s issues started years before its recent struggles.\n\nIn 2018, when Giannandrea arrived from Google to run the newly formed AI group, his hiring was seen by the tech industry as a coup for Apple. While some executives thought Giannandrea would be more interested in overseeing the company’s self-driving–car project—which it has since shelved—he took a special interest in Siri, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nAt the time, Siri, which Apple had released as a feature on iPhones in 2011, had begun to stagnate. It struggled to answer general knowledge questions and offered limited support for third-party apps.\n\nEven before Giannandrea took control of the assistant, members of the group working on Siri felt like second-class citizens at Apple. Siri engineers were frustrated by the software engineering team’s control over iOS updates, feeling that they weren’t prioritizing fixes for Siri, according to former Apple employees with direct knowledge of the matter. The software engineers, for their part, felt the Siri team couldn’t keep up with supporting new features that came out of Federighi’s group.\n\nGiannandrea told others he was confident he could fix Siri by adopting the playbook Google had followed to build its own AI-powered voice assistant. He believed Apple simply needed the right training data and had to get better at scraping answers from the web to answer general knowledge questions, according to a person who spoke to him about it.\n\nIn some ways, Giannandrea stood out among his colleagues at Apple. Those who have worked with him describe him as relaxed, quiet and nonconfrontational—a contrast to many other members of Apple’s executive team, some of whom were known for their demanding, type A personalities.\n\nGiannandrea often has described to employees his belief that machine learning can lead to incremental improvements in products, eventually adding up to major gains, a concept he refers to as hill climbing. He also has expressed a dim view of chatbots in the past, telling Apple employees before and immediately after the release of ChatGPT that he didn’t believe they added much value for users.\n\nAfter he joined, some of his colleagues told Giannandrea he should shake up Siri’s leadership, but he didn’t do so, according to former Apple employees who worked in the AI group.\n\nOne Siri leader often criticized by colleagues was Walker, who joined Apple in 2013 and became responsible for its daily operations at the end of 2022. In the eyes of his critics, Walker was unwilling to take big risks on Siri and focused on metrics that didn’t move the needle much on its performance, rather than having a grand vision for overhauling the voice assistant.\n\nFor instance, he often celebrated small wins such as reducing by minute percentages the delay between when someone asked Siri a question and when it responded, former Apple engineers said. Another pet Walker project was removing the “hey” from the “hey Siri” voice command used to invoke the assistant, which took more than two years to accomplish, they said.\n\nAnd last year, Walker dismissed an effort by a team of engineers to use LLMs to give Siri more emotional sensitivity so it could detect and give appropriate responses to users in distress, said a person with direct knowledge.\n\nWalker told colleagues he wanted to focus on the next release of Siri rather than commit resources to the project. Without his knowledge, the project’s engineers bypassed him to continue working on those capabilities with the software engineering group’s safety and location team.\n\n— Higher Pay, Faster Promotions\n\nOver time, relations between Federighi’s software engineering group and Giannandrea’s AI team have gotten increasingly tense—and at times downright dysfunctional.\n\nStylistically, the two executives couldn’t be more different. Federighi’s tough and demanding management style contrasts with Giannandrea’s laid-back approach. When they are in meetings together, Federighi is known to bombard his colleagues with questions, while Giannandrea tends to do more listening, according to people who have been in meetings with them.\n\nOther resentments also built up. Some in the software engineering group were annoyed by the higher pay and faster promotions their colleagues in the AI group were receiving. And they were bitter that some engineers in the AI group seemed to be able to take longer vacations and leave early on Fridays, while they faced more-punishing work schedules.\n\nDistrust between the two groups got so bad that earlier this year one of Giannandrea’s deputies asked engineers to extensively document the development of a joint project so that if it failed, Federighi’s group couldn’t scapegoat the AI team.\n\nIt didn’t help the relations between the groups when Federighi began amassing his own team of hundreds of machine-learning engineers that goes by the name Intelligent Systems and is run by one of Federighi’s top deputies, Sebastien Marineau-Mes.\n\nOver the years, Intelligent Systems has trained its own models and built demos that enabled users to control apps with voice commands, often without help from the Siri team. That created tensions with the Siri group. In one internal Apple presentation, a member of Intelligent Systems showed a slide depicting an animation of two mountains smashed together and flattened, which some saw as a subtle dig at Giannandrea’s hill-climbing philosophy, according to two people with direct knowledge.\n\nAround 2022, the Intelligent Systems team began working with Walker and Rockwell, the executive in charge of Vision Pro, on a project code-named Link that soon went south, said four former Apple employees with direct knowledge of the project. The goal of the effort was to develop voice commands to control apps and complete tasks for the mixed reality headset and future augmented reality glasses.\n\nEngineers who attended meetings on the three-way collaboration were struck by the open hostility of Rockwell and Marineau-Mes toward Walker, the day-to-day Siri leader. The two frequently voiced their frustration with Walker over Siri’s slow progress in supporting the Vision Pro.\n\nFor example, Rockwell wanted to allow people wearing the headset to use Siri to navigate the web and resize windows with just their voices. He also wanted two people communicating with each other in a virtual space to be able to interact with Siri together so they could, say, plan a joint vacation.\n\nBut some members of the Siri team were doubtful the team could achieve that goal. Eventually, many of the Siri features Rockwell envisioned for the Vision Pro were pared back because of the Siri team’s inability to achieve them, the people said.",

                "comment": "— AI Excitement Builds\n\nIn November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT to a thunderous response from the tech industry and public. Within Giannandrea’s AI team, however, senior leaders didn’t respond with a sense of urgency, according to former engineers who were on the team at the time.\n\nThe reaction was different inside Federighi’s software engineering group. Senior leaders of the Intelligent Systems team immediately began sharing papers about LLMs and openly talking about how they could be used to improve the iPhone, said multiple former Apple employees.\n\nExcitement began to build within the software engineering group after members of the Intelligent Systems team presented demos to Federighi showcasing what could be achieved on iPhones with AI. Using OpenAI’s models, the demos showed how AI could understand content on a user’s phone screen and enable more conversational speech for navigating apps and performing other tasks.\n\nFormer Apple employees said executives in the AI and software engineering groups scrambled to claim ownership of new features powered by LLMs. In many cases, software engineering came out on top, thanks to its strong reputation for delivering results.\n\nDespite the company’s experimentation with OpenAI’s models, Apple managers told their engineers in 2023 they couldn’t include models from outside companies in final Apple products and could only use them to benchmark against its in-house models.\n\nBuilding the large Apple models meant to compete with OpenAI was the responsibility of Giannandrea’s group. However, they didn’t perform nearly as well as OpenAI’s technology, according to multiple former Apple employees who used the models in 2023 and 2024.\n\n\n— A Dubious Demo\n\nFinally, last June Apple announced a suite of AI-powered features under the umbrella name Apple Intelligence. This suite included writing and image-generation tools, new photo-editing and mail features, and upgrades to Siri. And in a reversal of its opposition to working with AI models made by other companies, Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI to offer ChatGPT as an extension for answering questions or performing tasks its own models couldn’t handle.\n\nDuring an onstage demo at the conference, one Apple executive asked Siri when her mom’s flight would land. The voice assistant accessed her email and real-time flight data to provide the current arrival time. She then asked Siri to remind her about their lunch plans, and the assistant plucked the details from her iPhone’s messages and plotted a route from the airport to the restaurant.\n\nAmong members of the Siri team at Apple, though, the demonstration was a surprise. They had never seen working versions of the capabilities, according to a former Apple employee. At the time, the only new feature from the demonstration that was activated for test devices was a pulsing, colorful ribbon that appeared on the edges of the iPhone’s screen when a user invoked Siri, the former employee said.\n\nFor Apple, the Siri demo was a break from its past practice. Historically, Apple would only show features and products at its conferences that were already working on test devices and that its marketing team had vetted to ensure they could be released on time.\n\nStill, the event impressed outsiders. Apple’s shares shot up more than 10% in the two days after announcement of the features, as Wall Street showed relief that the company had come up with an AI plan.\n\nSome former Apple employees said they’re optimistic that Federighi and Rockwell can turn things around for Siri, given that they are typically more hands-on than Giannandrea and Walker, who have tended to rely more on their direct reports to manage things.\n\nFederighi, for one, often knows more technical details about software projects than the junior engineers working on them. Rockwell, who joined Apple in 2015, is seen within the company as a leader with vision, who can bring fresh thinking to projects while skillfully navigating the corporate culture.\n\nFederighi has already shaken things up. In a departure from previous policy, he has instructed Siri’s machine-learning engineers to do whatever it takes to build the best AI features, even if it means using open-source models from other companies in its software products as opposed to Apple’s own models, according to a person familiar with the matter.",

                "comment": "From the article: Apple has lost its position as the world's most valuable public company to Microsoft following a dramatic four-day slide in its stock price, driven largely by concerns over President Donald Trump's escalating tariff war with China, where most of its iPhones are assembled.\n\nApple's market capitalization fell to $2.59 trillion as of Tuesday's close, while Microsoft now sits at $2.64 trillion, reclaiming the top spot after briefly holding it earlier this year.\n\nApple shares have plummeted approximately 23% over just four trading sessions, shaving $700 billion off its value, as panicked investors dump stock due to the company's exposure to China for manufacturing and sales. Apple relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing for its flagship products, making it especially vulnerable to Trump's aggressive tariff policies.\n\nThe broader market has been shaken by Trump's announcement of substantial tariffs on imports from more than 100 countries, with the Nasdaq dropping 13% over the same four-day period. However, Apple's decline has outpaced other tech companies due to its particular vulnerability to U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\nUBS analysts have predicted that the price of the iPhone 16 Pro Max could increase by as much as $350 in the United States as a result of the tariffs. The potential price hike raises questions about how consumers might respond to significantly more expensive Apple products.\n\nApple has been exploring manufacturing diversification in countries like India and Vietnam in recent years, but analysts suggest it would be nearly impossible for the company to quickly shift its complex supply chain away from China. That's despite President Trump saying he \"absolutely\" believes that Apple could manufacture its iPhones and other devices in the United States. Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously said that China's manufacturing expertise and scale are unmatched globally.\n\nBoth Apple and Microsoft, along with chipmaker Nvidia, had recently achieved market valuations exceeding $3 trillion before the current market turbulence began.\n\nMicrosoft appears somewhat insulated from the worst effects of the tariffs, with Jefferies analysts recently including the company among those they view as better positioned to weather the current uncertainty.\n\nThe two tech giants have traded the \"most valuable company\" title several times in recent years, with Microsoft claiming the top spot in early 2024 before Apple regained it – only to lose it again during this week's market volatility.\n\nAccording to one report, Apple earlier this week urgently requested suppliers to ship as many premium devices as possible to the U.S. by air freight before Trump's falsely-described \"reciprocal\" tariffs of 104% on China came into effect Wednesday. China has since retaliated by slapping 84% tariffs on U.S. goods.",

Stocks go up when people THINK the company is doing well (sure, there are reality driven things like earning calls that affect stock prices, but those are usually \"corrections\" to the perception. People buy stock before the earning calls, before product announcements, etc. based on what they PERCEIVE is going to happen, then correct if their perception is changed by reality).\n\nTo your point about Apple, I'd say they are equal parts hardware and software at this point. But if we're picking one to say what they are \"at heart\", I'd actually say they are, at their heart, a software company. Remember there was a small period of time where they licensed Mac OS to run on non-Apple made hardware, which if they were a hardware company at heart, they likely wouldn't have done. Most of their stuff around hardware has been because they realized to create the best software, you have to tightly control the hardware.\n\nDrivers are probably the number one cause of issues on Windows. Drivers exist because you can't bake the hardware/software interaction layers into the OS if your OS needs to be able to support third party devices. If you only support specific hardware, you don't really need to support drivers. (I'm simplifying this a lot, I know there's a lot packed into \"hardware/software interaction layers\", but the details are irrelevant to the point). Prior to designing their own hardware, they would just select specific hardware from other companies and only support that hardware and bake those things into their OS.\n\nThe reason Apple is hit harder by this is because of this exact perception that you stated. Both Microsoft and Apple are hardware and software companies (Microsoft has Azure cloud hardware, Surface line of products, Xbox, even things like Holo Lens and stuff). But when people thing of Microsoft, they think of Windows and Office. Mostly the software. When people think of Apple, they think of iPhone and Mac. Mostly the hardware.\n\nSo if tariffs are going to affect your stock price, the company that people think of the hardware first is the company that is going to be hit hardest, even if Apple at it's heart is a software company.\n\nBecause of the Azure hardware infrastructure, and the surface line, and the Xbox, Microsoft is likely to be hit REALLY hard by the tariffs as well (one could argue even harder as the impact will be less up-front, meaning people are less likely to associate cost increases with tariffs and get pissed at Microsoft instead of who is actually to blame). But because people don't perceive them as a hardware company as much as Apple, people are not dumping their stock as much as they are dumping Apple's.",

Remember that prior to being CEO, was their Chief Operation Officer. This kind of logistic & contingency planning is EXACTLY what he excels at.\n\nSure, none of the things he did/is doing will negate the effects of the tariffs, but given that he doesn't have a crystal ball to tell him exactly what would happen, he did as good (if not better) than almost any other CEO could have given the information and situation.

China isn't the cheapest manufacturing center in the world - hasn't been for years. They are the best at advanced manufacturing, which is more important...\n\n> There’s a confusion about China. The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I’m not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being the low-labor-cost country many years ago. And that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view. The reason is because of the skill, and the quantity of skill in one location and the type of skill it is.\n\n",

Or why should I provide extra tax money to create programs that educate people on the dangers of driving while drunk. I should just wait for them to ruin their lives, and then society has no choice but to step in. Do you see the flaws in your logic, or should I allow so many young uneducated people to ruin their lives financially that the housing system starts to collapse because most people can’t afford to build homes or buy cars and then say oh snap maybe we should have had programs in place to educate people better about financial literacy so now we have to subsidize the car manufacturers again or subsidize affordable housing. ",

Progressives (who are not socialist) are named as such simply due to their perceived desire for progress on social issues (i.e. eliminating discrimination) and the happiness of domestic workers. “Liberal” is a complicated term. In the classical sense, Republicans and Democrats are overwhelmingly both liberal (i.e. rule of law, private property, individualism, etc), certainly on the Democrat side but all non-far-right and many far-right Republicans as well. \n\nWhat you’ve taken issue with is infighting between capitalists on whether to continue the status quo America has shepherded for decades or to pursue a major rework of the global capitalist framework. It’s not a “left” issue, it’s an issue between different capitalist camps, some of whom present themselves as socially liberal.",

The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor costs.

The reason is because of the skill, the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill it is.\n\n> Like the products we do require really advanced tooling, and the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with the materials we do are state of the art. And the tooling skill is very deep here. You know, in the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I’m not sure we could fill the room.

But there are two problems with this idiotic plan 1) consumers pay more for products during the tariffs and *if* the manufacturers shift to the US then 2) consumers pay the higher product price *permanently*. It’s a lose - lose for consumers.",

The American women happened to have the best skills since most men were drafted for the war. I was not aware there were many schools to train college graduates to become precision tool engineer. Most mechanical engineers were more into computer calculation, simulations or management.  There are not too many hands on good in practice and good in theory. Most robatics, automation used here have an Asian flavor.  Japan and Taiwan are the best.  Most people prefer Taiwan made machinery, small high resolution equipments and automation machinery.",

                "comment": "I know this might go against the grain here, but I actually think bringing some of these industries, like electronics manufacturing, back to the U.S. is a smart long term move.\n\nTwelve years ago, if someone asked me whether the U.S. could have a globally competitive car company, I would’ve said no. But look at Tesla now. They’re not only competing, they’re dominating. The Model Y was the most sold car globally in 2023 and it’s one of the most “American-made” cars out there. The only thing to slow sales is Elons antics. \n\nSo why do we assume we have to outsource complex manufacturing to China? Sure, labor’s cheaper, but when you factor in things like supply chain risks, IP theft, and national security, there’s real value in having some of this stuff made here.\n\nIt’s already happening anyway. In 2021 alone, over 260,000 jobs were reshored back to the U.S., which was a record year. And it’s not just old-school stuff either. EV components, semiconductors, green tech. All of it.\n\nMeanwhile, we keep talking about the “future of work” like it’s just coding jobs forever, but AI is changing that fast. Not saying coding goes away completely, but a lot of roles are already being automated or assisted by AI to the point where you need less people doing the same work. There’s gonna be impact, and not in some far off future. It’s already started.\n\nAnd honestly, once you lose the infrastructure to produce real things, you don’t get it back easily. I’ve watched this happen in my own industry. Jobs don’t just disappear they get slowly outsourced until there’s no local talent left to even do the work if we wanted to bring it back.\n\nI don’t think reshoring is about being protectionist. It’s just strategic. And yeah, it’s hard. But Tesla already showed we can build something world-class right here.",

Low-mid tier watch companies have been outsourcing at least in part some of the movement parts' manufacturing to China. Even the reputable ones like Seiko who I believe who source parts for their mid tier movements.\n\nSo guess what the latest hype is sweeping the mechanical watch community? Chinese watches. At first instinct you would expect it to be some cheap, shit quality stuff but apparently China has been learning and are producing ultra high quality movements for the fraction of the cost we have been charged so far by Swiss and Japanese companies. Even the fancy complications like Tourbillons. \n\nThe most extreme example is this watch called Behrens Perigee. Fully mechanical, it's got chain drive, retrograde time, moon phase, earth rotation. Might sound silly but these are complications that when done mechanically are ridiculously delicate and complex machines, which collectors put a lot of value into. This watch cost between 13-20k USD, but the same set of complications if it were to be made by MB&F (ultra high end Swiss watchmaker that does crazy shit like this, fully manufactured in house in Switzerland ) would cost upwards of 100k USD. And it's not like some budget quality or something, everything from details to the finish and the housing is what you would expect from a 100k Swiss watch.\n\nSo look at what China has done here. The reason this is so expensive to make in Switzerland is because it's extreme precision manufacturing of 100s of tiny parts, has to be hand assembled and tested, with long lead times so production capacity is also limited and high labour cost. China has figured out how to mass produce (relatively speaking) precision components to high quality of finish with low enough costs either through labour or automation to undercut an equivalent Swiss product by 80%. \n\nIf this is what China's maker machine can do for a product that is notoriously finicky due to tiny size and difficult to scale capacity, one can only imagine how good they are at large castings, machining, forgings possibly even ALM. Where they are lacking is design, I.e. they don't know what to make, but don't underestimate their ability to make it.",

People in this part of the thread are talking about what Democrats need to do to connect with people and have better strategies for showing why social programs work.\n\nI think they need to take situations like your wife experienced and just ask people the questions: \n\n\"If you leave a job and have unused vacation time, do you think you should be paid out for that? After all, you earned it.\"\n\n\"if you get injured and have no way of working, wouldn't it be nice to have some form of assistance that you were required to receive so that your life doesn't fall apart?\"\n\nYou have to ask these questions and leave politics out out of it. Then, when you get what I expect would be the likely answers, \"yes, and yes,\" you need to succinctly explain what party is for those things, and what party has been historically against those things.\n\nI had a similar type of conversation with a member of my wife's family years ago when we discussed net neutrality. I posed it this way:\n\n\"What would you do if you walked into your house one day and all of your lights were only emitting 50% of the light they were capable of emitting? You were surprised, so you looked into it and discovered that your electricity provider has a new requirement that you must have lightbulbs manufactured by them, or through a company associated with them to get 100% of the light that is possible.\"\n\nHe said \"I wouldn't like that! That's dumb!\"\n\nI then did another question focused on the same scenario, but with a stove that would not heat to anything above 250°, because the gas company was now requiring you to have stoves manufactured by them, or companies they were partnered with.\n\nHis response: \"I wouldn't like that! That's ridiculous!\" \n\nSo I then explained the risk of net neutrality ending by saying \"what if all of a sudden, like those previous scenarios, you could not access certain websites because your Internet service provider restricted them, or, what if certain streaming platforms capable of 1080p HD content only streamed 720P SD content because your ISP didn't like that company and wanted you to stream their own movies for a fee to have higher quality video?\"\n\nAgain, same response as the previous two scenarios. He didn't like the idea. He hated it, he did not think it was fair.\n\nAs soon as I told him that Barack Obama Obama was trying to ensure that net neutrality remained...\n\n\"No no no, he's trying to stifle competition and innovation and blah blah blah...\"\n\nAs soon as I mentioned anything about Democrats being for that neutrality, he just completely deviated from fully agreeing with me based on things that just seem like common sense. \n\nIt does not work for everyone, but we have to find ways to make questions like this resonate, make the answers resonate, make the reaction be felt, and get people to understand that many of the people they vote for are for policies that actively harm them and make life worse.",

No one can deny that the US has world-leading universities, but how many students want to attend one? And what do they want to study?\n\nThis is something I'd really like someone at a Chinese university to chime in on, because it's long bugged me. If you're an absolutely top tier math or CS student at an American university, where are you likely to go after graduating? Very likely you'll end up at Jane Street, HRT, etc trying to squeeze out another 0.01% on trades of soybean futures. Why? Because they'll pay you $800k to do so. But that contributes nothing to the country or the world. Does the same dynamic exist elsewhere? I've often heard it claimed that in Taiwan, for example, working as a TSMC engineer is very prestigious. I can think of vanishingly few examples in the US where that can be said for anything manufacturing related. Maybe the space/rocket stuff. Obviously, Chinese students will be just as financially motivated, but what sectors does that lead them to?\n\nThere's also the culture war aspect. Do rural Chinese parents ever tell their children not to go to the big city university because it's \"liberal brainwashing\"? I'm sure there's *some* of that. But the cultural attitudes against education in the US seem to run very deep.",

I’m not sure I understand this stance. A large part of the entire argument for our existing health care system being trash and our populations health also being trash is that we systematically disincentivize our society from properly managing their health. Health is obviously broader than health care, and requires changes elsewhere (being able to take off work when sick or when you have an appointment as an example) to truly “fix” the problem, but enabling people who cannot or do not currently utilize health care as much as they should is absolutely a massive reason for why UHC is good to begin with. More participants in the program means healthier participants meaning the cost burden is even further reduced for all participants.",

The distance to from the northernmost point of Germany to the southernmost is about 600 miles. If you drive dead west from LA, you barely get to the eastern edge of Arizona. \n\nThis is not to say all of the things you listed aren’t bigger factors, but it seems like the distance between major cities in the US can also be a significant barrier for production of these things. This kind of ties into your point about the cost, as it seems to me the cost for something like this would be much higher per capita due to the land mass.

But lets say a phone costs $600 now. The new tariffs would add another $200 to that. Depending on your fuel mileage you may get around 500 miles and back for that money. So if you live closer to 500 miles of the Canadian or Mexican boarder it can be cheaper to buy your phone there.

Although Apple has production in India, Vietnam and Thailand, those countries also face increased tariffs as part of Trump’s sweeping plan.\n\n>Analysts say Apple will likely either need to raise prices or eat additional tariff costs when the new duties come into effect. UBS analysts estimated on Monday that Apple’s highest-end iPhone could rise in price by about $350, or around 30%, from its current price of $1,199.\n\n>Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote that he expects Apple to raise prices, or the company could suffer as much as a 15% cut to earnings per share. Apple may also be able to rearrange its supply chain so that imports to the U.S. come from other countries with lower tariffs.",

Yet today he is still planning to move *more* of his supply chain to India now to please his best buddy Trump. Today everywhere Cook moved the supply chain is tariffed and he is spending more on production for worse quality. He has failed in his goal while supporting policies that hurt Apple. What a disgrace\n\nWorst of all, Tim has cancelled all new project to save money while dumping billions into buybacks at nosebleed valuation. Today those buybacks are deeply underwater, while the investors he sought to incentivize to hold stock have mostly abandoned the company, effectively pocketing the buybacks. How did that benefit *current* apple shareholders? It didn't and doesn't! \n\nApple has abandoned its hardware design prowess to focus on becoming Netflix with expensive \"services\" of dubious reputation. Despite being valued at number one, Apple pines for the status of top streaming service, rather than top in hardware. What is Tim doing with this company? Where is the vision?\n\nJobs would be rolling over in his grave if he saw what this bean counter Trump flunky had done with his company",

The first $800 would be exempt. If you're traveling with family it could be up to $3,200 if pooled together. The duty is also only 3% for the next $1,000 after that (after that it gets tricky based on classification).\n\nSo a $1,800 iPhone would have no duty if you pooled it with spouse/family, or if by yourself, it would only be a $30 duty.\n\nThe above assumes you've been in that country for 48 hours or more. Less than that and the per person exemption is $200.\n\n>Also, what happened to California’s independent tariff negotiations? Can blue states just band together and say they’re not on board with this nonsense?\n\nWhat Newsom is trying to do is negotiate on the tariffs other countries would place on imports from California.  This is something that he, a virtually anyone else, has the legal ability to do, but with less leverage since tariff reciprocity is dependent on the federal government.  So it may be something like, \"Hey China, if you don't tax the wine coming from California, we'll give you tax breaks on the state taxes you may be paying on operations within California\".

You went from “the media didn’t care about Apple’s loss in 2022” (debunked and evidence provided, they did) to “the lovely media always said things were great (quotes to the contrary provided directly addressing fears of recession and high inflation being a problem), and now we are on “THE DOOMER CRAP IS EVERYWHERE”. You know where the doomer crap was when Biden was in office? Yeah, that’s Fox News, etc. Places like that were a cesspool of doom for the entire Biden administration.

Because it is helping bring important government policies and decisions to light that have a measurable impact on citizens/consumers, and we are seeing far too little of that in the world right now.\n\nDoes the Verge always do the best job at things?

If only there was some way *both of us* could have our preference respected, like say, oh I don't know, the \"allow apps from\" setting that has worked just fine on MacOS for over a decade. Your assertion that this would somehow remove your choice to keep this setting off and use the App Store, which 99% of your apps will come from anyway, is laughable at best.\n\nI want an iPhone because I have a disability and Apple has the best accessibility features out of all the mobile platforms.  Also because despite them being ridiculous by restricting which apps I can run on my device that I bought and paid for, they *have* made the right decisions in certain critical areas like privacy.\n\nThe wall garden is by far the worst part. I hate the arbitrary nature of what gets approved, how you lose access to purchases if developers remove them from the store or update them with a subscription model, how you can't easily hold onto older versions of apps, how Apple blocks developers from using certain private APIs, how Apple dictates what I can run and how.  The preposterous examples of Apple approving an \"Asian Boobs\" app but denying the  Kama Sutra app. The ridiculous subscription model Apple pushes. The Apple tax.\n\nI don't see how allowing apps from outside the store would ruin anything. The power users can have access to that, while the rest of you will stick to the App Store with the same quality you know and love today. \n\nI'm not asking for a pony.

I have rode the original iPhone SE in the recycled 5s casing into the sunset until the 12 mini came out. I now have the 13 mini, I have a spare unopened 13 mini. I have tried & mildly enjoyed bigger phones for \"premium features\" and eventually moved back to the mini because nothing since the 12/13 minis release has really felt like a gotta have. Maybe usb-c but im willing to live without that for the form factor.\n\nThe clamshell fold isn't it for me. I've held and played with the android ones.\n\nCan't speak for all mini enjoyers but the allure of the mini for me and where the advent of the 12mini finally moved small phone into fully-capable phone territory is the blend of convenient utility with all the bells and whistles. The convenience for me is absolutely derived from the size of the phone, it's one I enjoy using and brings me joy. It's one where if I want to i can still watch youtube vids n stuff but generally even the biggest phone sucks at this experience, and I just use my desktop or tv to watch stuff. Like the biggest phone screen is still a tiny portable screen that is way smaller than an ipad screen and that's just not very great for any media consumption. I don't see the difference between an iphone mini and a maytag refrigerator sized iphone 42069 giga pro max in terms of a media consumption experience at all, it feels the same to me (its a small screen that fits in your pocket). When people say bigger screen for watching stuff, it's just not a justification that resonates with me and I've tried all the phone sizes. \n\nPocketability, surprisingly, isn't the biggest thing i care about with iphone sizes. They are all sized to fit inside someones pocket. With that said, the clam fold phones just don't offer anything special to me I actually think their pocketability sucks. More importantly there's just no way they're going to provide a \"mini\" form factor when opened, and in a folded state it's really not going to be small. In it's folded state, the proper phone resolutions sort of just warrant a device that turns into a square brick that is just an awkward size with double thickness when folded.They'll for big/regular phone sizes once open. So unless they make something with the current iphone mini dimensions when open, i probably wont care too much. \n\nAnd if im gonna commit to jumping ship to a big phone knowing that, give me the book mode. At least i gain a shit ton of utility by ceding to the big-phone gods by also having what effectively is a whole ass tablet. If you're gonna go big, go all the way. Clamshells to date have been pointless for me & i highly doubt apple is going to try and actually strive for small form factors with a clamshell. It'll probably be regular iphone sized but folded. Clam fold feels like a party trick that's cool for like maybe 5 seconds.",

They make a fantastic leverage point for governments. \n\nFortunately they have been able to resist some of their attempts so far, such as in this case. The UK has little power over Apple (though regimes like in the US and China are another story).\n\nBut wouldn't it be better if they, at minimum, offered an API for competing storage providers, so that they could be backed up in the background to a service of our choosing? There is no technical or UX reason why they cannot do this, and they could restrict the level of resources provided or only allow this while the device is charging. But that would cut into their profits. They are relying on services revenue to deliver growth now that device sales have flatlined.\n\nCurrently you can install a competing cloud storage app, but it cannot back up much of the data on your iOS device, and can only do so while the app is open and running.\n\nOr wouldn't it be great if we could read the code underlying any encryption software used, to increase confidence that Apple had not capitulated to an authoritarian government's request to install a black door? \n\nGiven what is happening globally, I don't hold out much hope on them holding out forever. A binary blob the user cannot inspect or compile themselves cannot be trusted, in principle.\n\nBut Apple's whole business model for iOS goes against doing the above. It is ironic (though understandable) they have become viewed as a champion of user privacy while their approach for achieving it seems built on quicksand.\n\nI am as trapped in the ecosystem as anyone else is, but as a UK citizen I am increasingly looking towards more open alternatives.",

The main reason for the potential postponement is reportedly tied to \"major engineering hiccups\" with the revamped Siri voice assistant that will power the device.\n\nInitially, Apple had hoped to release the product by now, and there were reports suggesting it might still arrive around the time of this year's iPhone 17 series launch in September. Now, those plans appear to be in jeopardy.\n\n\"The major engineering hiccups related to the revamped Siri voice assistant ended up delaying the product,\" Gurman wrote. \"No big surprise there: The device will be primarily controlled by voice, and it depends on Siri and the underlying App Intents technology.\"\n\nDespite the delay, testing of the device – code-named J490 – continues at Apple headquarters. A large number of employees are also reportedly testing the hub in their homes.\n\nGurman compared the upcoming product to the Google Nest Hub, suggesting it won't \"make a big difference in terms of revenue\" for Apple. However, he noted that it could set the stage for more ambitious products in the future.\n\nOne such future product, code-named J595, is already in development. According to Gurman, this follow-up device will add \"an AI personality, additional sensors and a robotic arm that can maneuver the screen above your desk, kitchen counter or nightstand.\"\n\nThe delay of Apple's smart home hub ties in with the company's recent announcement that it needs more time to develop the promised more personalized version of Siri, which was previewed at WWDC 2024 last June. Apple stated these features would arrive \"in the coming year,\" suggesting they won't be ready until sometime between iOS 19 in September 2025 and iOS 19.4 in March 2026.",

They’re not doomed as many in the space state as your mentioning consumers are getting zero to no benefit, but as the apps embed, as they dial in what to prioritize, they have a unique position of having a more technically ambitious product that could deliver.",

Price wise they are almost the same, that's why I can't decide which one to get; the 120 Hz display on the Pro is definitely a better choice coming from a Windows PC that was hooked to 180 Hz screens, but the 16 GBs of RAM don't look promising, and upgrading the Pro to 24 GBs bumps the price from 2150€ to 2650€ because it ships with 1TB SSD. I can't stretch that high at the moment, I'm paying the full price at the counter, no financing. Whatever I get will be used for occasional Lightroom edits and coding, mostly Python and C# in PyCharm and VSCode respectively. Of course, the occasional YouTube video, e-mails and general web usage. Thanks!!",

I started using some Sketchup and DaVinci Resolve, quickly learning through that and some YouTube research that 32GB RAM might be a better option to reduce swap usage and just make models/video editing run better.\n\nFast forward a week and I have another unit come in with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD. The battery life is 100%, but the SSD is at 89% life according to DrivDx (322 TBW with 175 power cycles, about 3100 power on hours).\n\nShould I stick with my original unit and bear the pain of swap usage or can I slip into the new unit and feel okay about the SSD's life? Obviously with tariffs the SSD is going to be harder/more expensive to replace, so I'm not super excited about it, but Backmarket does offer warranties and I'm planning on keeping this for about 4-6 years. Thank you in advance!",

But that at the launch of the iPhone 17 they'll tweak things slightly.\n\nMy bet is that during the keynote, per usual, they'll list off all of the things the phone is great on and how wonderful and magical it is BUT at the very end instead of announcing the price (again it's the smart strategy of show the people everything the product can do and then show the price to hopefully offset their fears), I have a STRONG feeling they just simply won't show the price in their official keynote, and then within minutes of the keynote ending the Internet will find out the actual price, I'm for sure thinking over $2,300, and it'll spread like wildfire online. \n\n\\--\n\nAs employees we still get massive discounts upon discounts that we can stack, so while this would effect us, my phone is also bought and paid for by Apple (I haven't paid a phone bill in two years).... I'm not bragging, I really think companies SHOULD be treating their workers right.\n\nBut this is all to say, all of this fucking bullshit shouldn't be happening. It's the oligarchs going for the final missing piece of wealth they don't have is all.",

I work in television and film production in the specialty of the camera department, so I never cared that I was essentially on an endless $60 a month loan for the latest and greatest iPhone for years, because it always paid off in the long run. \n\nHowever, I will not be paying more than $65 a month over the course of 24 months if this rumor (or realistically, plausible possibility) pans out to be true. So either I lose (not by much since the upgrades between 16 promax and 17 pro Max will be minimal at best), or Apple loses. \n\nI hope they understand this, and being the multi trillion dollar company that they are, will eat the initial price hikes since they can afford to while maintaining optimal R&D profits…. but … we all know this is highly unlikely.",

Where I do blame them is when the 3G and 3GS started selling for $99 and $199 respectively, and some people _still_ thought that was an unsubsidized price.

                "comment": "The context is important. You pay for what is given you on the original platform, the new updates need a lot of work and money (sometimes millions of dollars for a port), so asking for a small fee is ok.\n\nHow Sony does it is the best way, with most games you get a free patch on the PS4 version that allows them to run at 60 rock solid FPS and stays always at the highest resolution if it's dynamic, they did it for The Last of Us 2, Days Gone, God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn... plus they did it on many games that didn't get a native PS5 version like Infamous Second Son that now runs at 60 fps and it's magnificent. Considering many times it's only an unlock to the frame rate it's good that it's free, they did some QA to see if the game was stable throughout the game and that's it, didn't cost much.\n\nMeanwhile, games that have a remastered version available for PS5 can have the new native app available for only 10 €/bucks, and those 10 bucks usually include a LOT, Horizon Zero Dawn got ALL of its cutscenes re-done from scratch, TLOU2 got a new game mode to enjoy the perfect tps gameplay. These things took serious development efforts, new assets, many hours of work and so cost money to make.\n\nSo TLDR yeah those 60-80 dollars you spent on the original version still give you a better experience on the new console, and you get that experience even if you got the game used on ebay for 5€. BUT you can add 10 more to get a native version that will run a bit better and will be compatible with everything PS4 isn't, like VRR, 120 Hz output and so on. In fact people meme about GOW2018 getting a PS5 remaster but I actually hope it does so we can have a 10€ version that runs at 4k PSSR 120Hz, on PS6 it will probably run at 120 fps rock solid ffs.\n\nThe Nintendo thing is different though, I'm ok with paying for some updates for old games, like I'm sure the HDR implementation took some work because you can't just put the SDR version in an HDR container and get the best result, you have to put the effort into setting a brightness setting for all the various light sources and so on - labour intensive. Automatic HDR things like Microsoft's and Nvidia's suck because they just put \"white = 100%\" and the rest is as bright as the colour of the pixel... it leads to clipping and gives an image that's too bright and doesn't have any kind of real HDR impact, it's just light in your face randomly.\n\nBut we still have to see if Nintendo will actually do something for the old Switch 1 version, like will they unlock the frame rate to 60? That way, with the paid update you get a new native Switch 2 version with VRR, HDR and other stuff that I repeat is not free to make.\n\nFor now all we know is that there is a series of games that will get a bigger free patch like Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, but I guess with those games they were sort of forced to make a free upgrade because graphics and performances weren't optimal on Switch 1, to say the least...",

So we get our chips from China, which are tariffed, increasing the cost of production. This conveys  price hike. Then, when we sell the finished product to someone in Japan, they have to pay the Tariff that Japan has imposed on American goods, which even further increases the price. Suddenly, it just makes so much more sense to buy from somewhere else.",

I’m just pointing out that isolated examples like backpack brands with niche audiences and high margins don’t really disprove the broader trend especially when we’re talking about mass market consumer tech like iPhones that are deeply tied to global supply chains and shareholder expectations.",

                "comment": "You’re free to hate dealerships and love Carmax, but you might wanna know what you’re talking about. Carmax has a reputation for selling junk cars because they will buy and overpay for pretty much any trade, and most of their inventory absolutely does not come from fleet. That’s part of it, but it’s mostly auction and then trades. They also buy crappy cars right from the dealerships that you hate so much. A typical Carmax location will have a lot more used car churn than any dealership selling new cars, and some of them will be lemons. It is the same risk at any dealership,  but the sheer volume of used cars they sell means there will be more stories about junk cars. \n\nMost “sleazy” car sales people will not screw you on a used car since they don’t make much money on it. Finance could screw you, though, admittedly. Most dealerships will also put some money into trades, with tires being the main sticking point between dealer and customer. Cars that don’t seem to be a good investment get sent to auction or Carmax lol. \n\nAs for Carvannah, when it works it works. When it doesn’t work, such as the title not being clean or there being unreported damage, there is basically nothing the customer can do. There is no oversight, no central location to talk to an employee in person. That’s not “misinformation” from a car guy (I am one, full disclosure) but a take from someone that actually knows the industry. And in my professional opinion, buying a car is probably gonna suck most anywhere and is gonna be worse real soon with the tariffs.",

At the same time, however, I believe even more people should know about the app, as a lot of time and effort has gone into building it. Especially for those looking for a clean and easy way to manage their personal finances, I truly believe this app is exactly what they are looking for.\n\nSo to help spread the word, I’ve decided to make the **Lifetime IAP completely free** until **7th April, 12:00 PM (CEST)**.\n\n**Here’s how to get it:**\n\n1. Download the app from the App Store: [https://apps.apple.com/app/id1640091876](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1640091876)\n2. After completing the initial setup, a pop-up will appear where you can unlock the \"Unlimited\" version for free.\n\nFor a sneak peek into the app's interface and a detailed breakdown of its features, feel free to check out the official website: [https://budget-flow.app](https://budget-flow.app/).\n\nAlso, if you like the app, feel free to recommend it to your friends / family or on social media.  \nIt really helps a lot! 😊",

From what I know, YNAB exports income and expenses into two separate columns: **\"Inflow\"** and **\"Outflow\"**, both as positive numbers. Budget Flow, however, expects a single **\"Amount\"** column and determines whether it’s income or expense based on the sign.\n\nTo import your data, you'll therefore need to go through the CSV import process twice:\n\n* In the app, go to **Settings => Sync & Data => CSV Import**.\n* Upload your CSV file from YNAB and map the relevant fields (Account, Category, etc.).\n* On the first run, map the **\"Amount\"** field to the **\"Inflow\"** column and set the type to **\"Income\"** manually. Then click import.\n* Repeat the process (field mapping) and finally map the \"Amount\" to the **\"Outflow\"** column and set the type to **\"Expense\"**.\n* Afterwards all your transactions should be imported sucessfully.\n\nMore detailed instructions can be found here: [How to Import CSV Files](\n\nIf anything doesn't work as expected, feel free to reach out—I’d be happy to assist. In fact, I’m currently improving the CSV import feature to allow more flexibility, and also plan to add help center articles specifically for migrating from YNAB and similar tools. So if you notice something that doesn't work as expected, please let me know and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible 😊",

It will even auto expand comments that you may have collapsed, which include the search phrase.\n- Translate Reddit content! There is now a translate option in the all menu for comments, long press menu for self post text, and the long press menu for post titles. (Only on iOS 18 and higher). The translate option will show up when content is in another language from the preferred language of your device.\n- Mute inbox notifications for posts from the ... menu or by long pressing on a post title\n- Mute inbox notifications for comments from the All swipe action or ... menu\n- Adds setting to mark posts as read after upvoting/downvoting in Settings > Posts\n- Automatically upvote posts & comments when saving. Turn this on with two new settings in Settings > Posts and Settings > Comments\n- Instead of seeing \"img\" in comments that have image emotes, there will now be a link to view the emote\n- Adds \"Copy Text\" option to the context menu when long pressing a post title\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixes an issue that would cause certain Youtube videos to not load\n- Fixes rare crash that could happen when loading a subreddit\n- Fixes another rare crash that could happen when opening Narwhal\n\n\n### Coming Soon\n\n- A re-design of albums to have horizontal scroll\n- More options for content filters\n- Mod tools\n\nIf anyone has any questions around Narwhal 2, iOS programming, what it's like to work on an app like this, etc., I am happy to answer!\n\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455\n\nhttps://narwhal.app",

Pressing that sort button would then bring up a list of the sorting options to choose from. \n\nI’ve really been liking the new search in comments option, and I’m really looking forward to the upcoming album viewer update.\n\nI absolutely love Narwhal and I’m not sure that I would still be on Reddit if it weren’t for your app!\n\nEdit: Quick question - Have you thought about turning Narwhal into a Mac app as well? Even if it was identical to the iPad version. I understand that this would increase the API costs, so could there be a way that you could have a separate “All-Access” subscription that included Mac, or something like that?

Reader mode for articles in the iPad App. This works fine on iPhone, but on my iPad links to online news articles still open the default webpage of the story, instead of presenting it in a clear and clean reader mode.\n\n2. Please allow installations of the iPad App on Macs with Silicone. AFAIK there is no usable Reddits app for Macs and I hate to use Browsers for other things than just occasional surfing. So please allow us to use the iPad Narwhal App also on Macs.\n\nThanks!",

I have just found that the CMD+period shortcut isn't used by anything in macOS, the closest is `SHIFT+⌘+.` which hides/reveals hidden files. The `⌥+A' shortcut is already used to produce the \"å\" character.\n\n~~* Make Antinote appear on active desktop.~~\n\n~~I use multiple virtual desktops. My primary setup is my main screen being in the middle with the terminal a three finger swipe to the right and the browser a three finger swipe to the left. If I activate Antinote on Safari or Ghostty/Warp/Terminal it grabs focus in that middle primary desktop screen and whooshes me away from what I was looking at. \"Desktop\" is probably not the right word for it since Safari and the terminal app are fullscreen apps, but something similar to what Spotlight does where it appears on the active screen would be nice.~~",

Apple notes has this widget just called \"Note\" and you can see the title and a couple lines but there's only one size option and it's the smallest. Maybe it could show more or less content depending on the size of the widget.\n\nIt's kinda funny now that I'm thinking about it cause sometimes I get to the point when I'm really chewing on an idea that I just like to see it everywhere. I'll print out copies and tape them to different parts of my house at eye level and it just kinda spurs my thinking in the moment and depending on what I'm doing it helps me look at it from a different perspective. If something pops up that is good enough I will find a way to record it, but just having the original thought in medium that isn't easily editable adds enough friction that I'm not focused on capturing every single thing that pops in my head about it. My gf thinks I'm nuts for doing this but I swear by it. \n\nI'm not sure if there's an app that will let me just that on my home screen and I'm sure it's opposite of what most people will ask for. It might be an interesting or terrible contrast to the mac apps goal of expendable/temporary notes if the notes were uneditable on mobile.",

Americans are fiercely sensitive to products formerly being $20 suddenly being $30. They’ll bury whomever oversaw it.\n\nThe main issue conservatives have is believing Trump has any plan. He generated his tariff plan with ChatGPT, which is why there’s tariffs on an island full of penguins. He flies by the seat of his pants and tends to only remember his most recent conversation with someone, who games him. Very dangerous.",

Because I bet you've been manipulated into thinking that everything on that network is a 100% lie.\n\nDo you have any proof that none of the tariffs worked, or are you really this ill-informed?  I'll direct your research to the steel industry.\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – Kevin Dempsey, president and CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), released the following statement regarding the 25 percent tariffs on steel imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, going into effect today:\n\n“AISI supports President Trump’s actions implementing tariffs on imported steel and eliminating the steel Section 232 exclusion process that has been exploited as a loophole by foreign producers seeking to avoid tariffs. The comprehensive program of national security tariffs and other measures on steel imports put in place in 2018 allowed the American steel industry to restart idled mills, rehire laid-off workers and begin investing tens of billions of dollars in new and upgraded plants. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of those measures has been eroded in recent years and foreign steel overproduction has led to increased dumping of excess foreign steel production onto world markets, as well as widespread transshipment and diversion of steel from third countries. AISI applauds the president’s actions to restore the integrity of the tariffs on steel and implement a robust and reinvigorated program to address unfair trade practices. America must have a sustainable, commercially viable steel industry to meet its national security needs.”\n\nThe border wall was incomplete because it was blocked by congress at every opportunity.  They actually blocked it over 5 billion dollars, which is nothing.  You must be new to politics.  Things are getting done now, because he was given an overwhelming mandate.\n\n\"If it happens, great.\"  That's sensible, at least, just keep an open mind.",

A single query to ChatGPT uses the same amount of energy that it takes to run an incandescent lightbulb for 15 minutes, which would drain a phone or laptop battery in no time. \n\nThat doesn't make Apple intelligence worthless, as it's capabilities to process text and actually learn how the user interacts with their phone makes it a much more capable assistant than old Siri\n\nFrom that standpoint, AI Siri is basically a connector that ties together different application applications and extensions based off of what you tell it to do \n\nTo proficiently use AI, you have to be aware of what model is best to use for a certain question. Asking o3 mini to give you a middle school level explanation of the theory of relativity will almost always end up with a worse result than asking ChatGPT 4o. Likewise, asking 4o to create an outline for a paper will also lead to a worse result than asking o3 mini. \n\nIt's the same with Siri, best used for on device connections and sending requests to other extensions like ChatGPT. Asking Siri to explain theoretical physics is probably not going to go very well.\n\nSo, next time you have an actual question, if you don't want to get a list of web results, tell Siri to ask ChatGPT.

If people want to upgrade now then it’s fine but I doubt we’ll see any increases until fall anyway. \n\nI’m also betting the 16e already accounted for factors like inflation and tariffs and why it seems so expensive. In another comment I mentioned how most new iPhone models released in the fall would likely see a $100-$200 price increase which lines up with what some experts claim to be more realistic price increase expectations around 10-15% at most. I think no matter what this Fall we’d see price increases no matter what with Pro redesigns and possible 120hz on base models.",

I bought the Apple Watch SE in 2021. In 2024 it updated itself to watchOS10. I didn't want to, it just did it. That rendered the watch practically unusable – it was buggy as hell and slow as hell. Apple forbids downgrades, so I was stuck with watchOS10. Then they declared my version of the watch obsolete in 2024. So, I got less than 3 years out of it. This was deliberate obsolescence. \n\nApple declare devices obsolete, not because they aren't capable, but because they prompt upgrades.",

Android phones are offered 2-3yrs of OS support on average, only Google (which has Apple prices) offers a more competitive 5 years. Apple gets significantly more, making it a better purchase for longevity. I have an iPhone 12 mini (2020) and it isn't even on the slate to lose OS updates until 2027. The new Mac Mini desktops quite literally have the most advanced CPU on the market right now and the cheapest one is 700 bucks.\n\nAre they repairable? No. Are they upgradable? No. Bad for the earth?

If you're asserting that Apple hardware is top-tier, we're 100% agreed, so we needn't debate that. So, in your example you mentioned that 2015 Macbooks are fine. I agree, they are, hardware-wise. The point I'm making is about software. Apple dropped software support for the latest Intel Macbooks (2019), not because they aren't capable of running Sonoma or Sequoia, but because they want Intel out of the picture and want people to upgrade hardware 2 years earlier than they otherwise would. That's shorter than the window allowed during the transition from PPC to Intel.\n\nSo, it isn't just the Apple Watch line, Apple prematurely discontinue products to bump the bottom line. There's nothing contentious in that – it's plain to see. \n\nOn phones, I've never used an Android phone or looked into how many years support they're offered, so I'll take your word on that.",

                "comment": "From the article: Apple stock dropped 4% in early Friday trading, broadly following yesterday's trend after China announced reciprocal tariffs in response to U.S. President Trump's trade policies.\n\nThe latest decline follows Thursday's dramatic 9% plunge that erased nearly $300 billion from Apple's market value – the company's worst single-day performance in five years – amid growing fears that Trump's trade war will hurt the global economy. Apple's market value was expected to be reduced further today as markets processed China's matching 34% tariff announcement.\n\nChina's finance ministry announced it would impose a matching 34% tariff on U.S. imports starting April 10, one day after Trump's new duties take effect. The country also restricted exports of rare earth elements critical for technology manufacturing and added 11 American businesses to its \"Unreliable Entity List.\"\n\nTrump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff plan particularly threatens Apple, which relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing despite years of diversification efforts. The 54% effective rate on Chinese imports combines the new 34% tariff with an existing 20% charge.\n\nCountries where Apple has been expanding its supply chain, including India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, were also targeted with tariffs above Trump's global baseline rate of 10%.\n\nAnalysts warn Apple faces difficult choices ahead, potentially needing to raise U.S. hardware prices by approximately 30% to offset the tariff impact or accept significant hits to its profit margins.",

These are factors over which management, clever as they are, has *absolutely no control.* I point out to you that if Cook and Company *had* been able to exert some sort of control, **they wouldn't have let the company's market capitalization collapse 25% since its late-December alltime high of nearly $4 billion!**\n\nWhen the seas stop pitching, I'll put my boat back in the water.

                "comment": "What codswallop. First off, I've been an independent, value-based investor for 40 years; unlike you, I have experienced good times for investors, bad times for investors and *terrible* times for investors, and I assure you that we are now in the latter - and likely for a couple of years.\n\nSecondly, you've made it very clear that *your* investment goals are very different from *my* investment goals - so why do you think *yours* are the investment methodologies to which I should subscribe? Like most amateur investors, you completely ignore the fact that different people have very different investment priorities, different risk tolerances and different investment timelines. You are clearly inexperienced enough in the game to think that everybody with money in the market is just like *you*, has the same priorities, and invests in the same things, for the same reasons. But, my arrogant friend, I'm here to tell you *it just ain't so!* \n\nThirdly, I'm a retiree who lives almost entirely off my investments. Until just a few weeks ago, Apple represented more than 30% of my portfolio, and I have done very well by incrementally buying and holding it since around 1993-4. However, as a retiree, *preservation of capital* is now my key concern, especially in extraordinary times like these. **Had I not sold when I did, my portfolio would have by now dropped by US$150,000 in the last two days alone. Does that sound like \"mistiming\" to you?** (Edit: now *$170,000* and still dropping!) Had I hung on when all the political signs pointed so strongly to \"sell!\", **my retirement income would have been reduced by more than $500 a month!** Could *your* income take that kind of shock without you having to make lifestyle adjustments?\n\nAnd fourthly, for what its worth, I agree with your substantive point - **dollar cost averaging, if done in a consistent and disciplined fashion, is indeed a good investment technique for young people with market horizons of 10 years or more;** I know it helped me build *my* net worth by more than two exponents. But it would be a very, *very* foolish technique for me to re-apply at this stage of my investment life. What's more, you must agree that these are highly extraordinary politico-economic times, and extraordinary times always, *always* require a clear-eyed reassessment of one's investment methodology. Which is why I sold.\n\nFinally, **you also wilfully ignore the fact that the economic and political forces now battering AAPL are entirely beyond management's ability to control, or even to mitigate. Apple's share price won't stabilize - much less bounce back - until the financial damage it has actually sustained is revealed in the next quarterlies, and its true financial picture going forward is parsed by Mr. Cook's guidance to its investors.** \n\nI still have enormous faith in the company's longterm viability, and will undoubtedly re-invest at some point - but for now, I'm out. And if, like me, your investment horizon is less than three years, you should be too.",

At least, I didn't touch it until just a few weeks ago - when I sold it all, because I saw this coming when Trump started blustering about tariffing literally *every one of the US major trading partners, beginning with Canada and Mexico*. \n\nWhy did I let it build up into such a seemingly imprudent percentage of my portfolio, you ask? Perhaps you don't understand this yet, but you will soon learn that a fundamental law of investing is \"sell your losers, let your winners ride\"; I let my *absolute best* winner ride for *a third of a century!*\n\nI've had great faith in the company throughout that time, through two years of Michael Spindler leading it, then a year of Don Amelio, 16 years of Steve Jobs, and finally 14 years of Tim Cook. And that faith has paid off handsomely, in fact, by *more than two exponents*. U jelly?\n\nAnd I *still* have great faith in this company - *over the long term.* But definitely not right now, because as I said, the forces now affecting it are far beyond management's control, and they really have few ways to counter those forces except to contract and consolidate their business, turtle-fashion and in a logical manner, instead of allowing market forces do it *for* them.",

        "description": "**Calipers** a simple app for places where the AR ruler doesn't work so well. It's got three modes:\n\n* **Tape Measure** measures distances accurate to within a few centimetres/inches\n* **Precision Ruler** measures distances accurate to 0.1mm or 1/64th of an inch\n* The ✨new✨ **Spirit Level** measures the tilt of surfaces and/or picture frames\n\nThis app has always been to fix a few bug bears I've had with the built-in measurement app. It all started when I needed to measure the width of a screw to buy a replacement - but couldn't find any **high quality** apps that do that. I thought since the pixels on your phone are so small in size, it should be possible to measure very small distances using your display.\n\nThe most recent addition is the Spirit Level. Now I know there is a spirit level built into iOS. I actually think this app is a real work of art, and it is very clever how it all works. However, it is also very much a form-over-function app. It uses very abstract concepts to show tilt, that make it real pain to read when you're actually using it to level something. And for the most common task - levelling a picture - it gives irrelevant information, and skips the basics like whether it's off tilt in the clockwise or anti-clockwise direction.\n\nIn Calipers, you can place your phone on a flat surface and there's an arrow so you know exactly where the tilt is, and the arrow gets longer the more tilted the surface is. Or, place your phone above a picture frame and it will show only the tilt of the picture frame, and two handles will show you which way to tilt the frame to make it level.\n\nWeeks has been spent tweaking the UI and all the subtle animations throughout the app to make it an absolute **delight to use**. It's available as a **one-time purchase** for $2, and I'm constantly adding new features to the app.\n\nIf you'd like to support an indie developer, the app is available at\n\n[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calipers/id6445826923](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calipers/id6445826923)\n\nAn of course, I'm happy to answer any questions!",

Camera cannot focus on such small distance if you put it right next to the wall (or on table), you need at least 5cm for it to work. That’s a major feature killer. (Also obviously it blocks all light so, double killer). I’m not sure if there any more hidden API which you can use to get this data from somewhere. I’m not sure if lidar on iPhone can work in this case (that would actually be nice). But most likely camera idea is not doable.\n\n2. You can get raw accelerometer and gyroscope data, 100hz frequency is kind of enough, depends on how it works inside (I suspect actual hardware has higher probe frequency and then have some SW which processes it). But it seems like you can just use Core Motion and get a phone displacement directly from this lib and it would do all the heavy lifting for you. I wonder what drift it would have though.",

It's just a vibe market. If your stock portfolio's value goes up, you're not making money unless you sell. Same for if it's going down. Too much of our economy is based on trading these imaginary \"stakes\" in companies we have nothing to do with. \n\nAm I happy about my \"gains\" being wiped out on my investment accounts? Hell no. But have I lost anything? No.\n\nWe don't yet know what these changes will do to the US or world economy. Economists don't know, either, because everything is just models. Actual humans are fairly unpredictable, and are geniuses at finding workarounds to any policy. In fact, this is the Achilles' heel of *any* ambitious policy change: It changes human behavior, often in ways we either didn't think of, or (more often) to a much greater degree than we guessed.\n\nWe'll see what happens, but I think it's all going to work out alright. Everything can be undone.\n\nOne silver lining I'm seeing to Trump 2.0, which I predicted and have been happy to see I was right about, is that it's lighting a fire under Congress to strip the Presidency of some of the insane powers it's been accumulating over the past century. Rand Paul (you know, that raving leftist lunatic /s) has put forth a bill to strip the Presidency of the ability to unilaterally set tariffs, which makes sense to me. If people start hurting from this too much, both parties will be under pressure to pass this, and then we won't have to worry about this again.\n\nI've been warning my fellow Americans about outsized Executive power for *decades* now. Whichever party that *doesn't* hold the White House sreams—rightfully—about Executive overreach, but when they get a majority and/or the White House... Nothing. They just abuse it themselves. I kept saying, \"One of these days, there's going to be a President who unabashedly uses all this power to do things that you *really* don't like, and we won't be able to do anything about it.\" Well, here we are! Hopefully this will finally change and Congress will start doing their jobs.\n\nAlso, for all the black-pilled: Everything that a President can do, another can undo. None of this stuff is permanent, because none of it is a law. In 2028, we'll know what ideas of Trump's worked (and I suspect some will), which ones don't, and whomever wins next will keep the good and jettison the bad. Trump is a chaos agent, but chaos is how organisms evolve. \n\nWe're going to emerge from this in a better place, no matter what. I believe that totally. The way out is through, friends.",

                "comment": "> Apple lost more than $250bn in market value on Thursday, making it one of Wall Street’s biggest casualties of Donald Trump’s tariff blitz despite chief executive Tim Cook’s efforts to court the administration.\n\n> Shares in the iPhone maker were down as much as 8.5 per cent as trading opened in New York on Thursday, enough to reduce its market capitalisation from $3.37tn to $3.12tn.\n\n> Trump hit all of Apple’s biggest supplier and manufacturing hubs in Asia, including China, Taiwan, India and Vietnam, with huge new tariffs on goods imported to the US.\n\n> The aggressive move will affect almost every model of iPhone, iPad, Mac and accessory that the tech giant sells.\n> The US president’s pledge to “liberate” the economy presents Cook with an unenviable choice between raising prices for its high-end electronics or swallowing the extra costs, which could wipe tens of billions of dollars off the profits that Apple investors have long prized.\n\n> \n> Apple in February pledged to hire 20,000 staff and invest $500bn in the US over the next four years, including a new facility manufacturing servers for artificial intelligence in Texas.\n\n> \n> However, Cook, who risked the ire of Apple staff by attending Trump’s inauguration and visiting the president at the White House, has not so far obtained any exemption from the new tariffs.\n> \n> The White House confirmed that there were no carve-outs for Apple in the president’s executive order.\n> On Wednesday night, the company declined to comment on whether there was any prospect of it securing an exemption from the levies, as it managed to do during Trump’s first term.\n> \n> Apple did not immediately respond to a further request for comment on Thursday.\n> \n> Analysts at Citi estimate that the iPhone maker has more than 90 per cent of its manufacturing in China, which is set to face combined tariffs of at least 54 per cent on imports to the US.\n> \n> Vietnam and India, which produce a growing number of Apple products including iPhones, AirPods and Watches, face “reciprocal” tariffs of 46 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively.\n> \n> However, semiconductors are currently exempt from the new tariffs, which could shield Apple, which is a customer of chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, from a 32 per cent “reciprocal” duty on the island nation.\n> \n> TSMC’s new plant in Arizona is believed to account for a large portion of the hundreds of billions of dollars that both Apple and Nvidia have pledged to spend on US production over the coming years.\n> \n> However, expanding that plant will probably become more expensive too, given the 20 per cent new tariff on imports from the EU, including from the critical Netherlands-based chip equipment manufacturer ASML.\n\n> Analysts at TD Cowen estimate that US sales account for almost a third of Apple’s total revenues, of which about three-quarters come from hardware products. The iPhone alone makes up almost two-thirds of US hardware revenues, they said.\n> \n> \n> “Based on the range of hardware products that Apple sells . . . and the countries that manufacture them, we estimate that every 10 per cent of tariffs would impact net income by 3.5-4 per cent” over the next two years, TD Cowen wrote in a note to clients.\n> \n> Analysts at Citi estimate a 9 per cent hit to Apple’s total gross margin if it cannot avoid the China tariffs as currently envisaged.\n> \n> Jefferies analysts say some 37mn iPhones will be imported into the US from China this year, reducing Apple’s net profit by 14 per cent unless it raises prices to compensate for the fees.\n> \n> The tariffs will send shockwaves through Apple’s supply chain, Jefferies said in a note on Thursday: “Even if Apple is exempted from the current tariffs, it will need to accelerate its supply chain diversification efforts, and thus needs to pay its suppliers better.”",

Cook also regularly receives RSUs that vest based on Apple's performance, with that award typically happening in October.\n\n>Apple executives that include Jeff Williams and Katherine Adams also received and sold stock worth $7,950,684 and $8,664,682, respectively.",

You know, it was my administration that got the ball rolling, because we wanted to keep America strong, especially in technology. People said, \"Mr. Trump, can we bring advanced chipmaking back to the U.S.?\" And I said, \"Of course we can—nobody brings jobs back like I do.\"\n\nIntel was struggling, losing billions—$18.8 billion!—but now, thanks to our efforts, they're getting back on track. We made sure the conversations happened. We stood up to the challenges. TSMC, a fantastic company, very smart people, is going to help Intel, and that means more advanced manufacturing right here in America.\n\nSure, there are concerns about layoffs; that's business. But we're focusing on growth, innovation, and making America the leader again. We don’t settle for second best. This deal? It’s a win. A big, beautiful win for American industry, for our workers, and for our future. Believe me.",

Shareholders needed to give him more time, there was 0 chance of him doing anything in under 10 years. Doesn’t matter who’s in charge. Microsoft was the same way, Balmer is just about the dumbest guy I think existed in the 90s and 00s but somehow he managed to make money and Microsoft still managed to come out OK due to having many different focuses, some of which paid off. They aren’t the best at anything but they make money. Intel needs a huge reset of the corporate structure to still exist in 10 years and I don’t think they are willing to do that. It’s the executive team that made intel the failure they are today. They all need to go, Pat should have stayed, at least a few more years.

Too bad, when opening anything in Sharepoint we will default to a random account and not let you change that account, so you don't have access to files and you end up having to use multiple browsers / browser profiles. \n* Files one OneDrive not opening by default in desktop apps and them removing the ability to set desktop apps to default. We are using the crappy web apps now that can't handle any document that has more than 2 tables and 10 pages. \n* \"Enable Microsoft 365 Experience\" button in Office web apps that I am not even sure what it does\n* Overall all web apps that they're pushing are laggy and lack a lot of features, but for some reason all apps open them as default.\n* Teams, Teams (new). New Teams (new), etc.\n* New Outlook lacking features from the old one, and I also find it hilarious that Outlook works better on a Mac than Windows machine\n* Paste with formatting being the default one, and even when you paste without, it will mess stuff up. \n* Mac specific, but all of the text manipulation shortcuts are messed up\n* Outlook not syncing stuff because \"some error\" and not telling you\n* Calendars not showing up in an organization because \"sync errors\" \n* \"We are autosaving you document\", but they're not\n* Oh you want to go to Sharepoint? I am gonna redirect you to OneDrive, but only sometimes. Why? Because f. you. \n* Windows updating randomly \"We are setting things up for you\"\n* You have to use a separate tool from microsoft to fully uninstall office from a computer.",

Pages makes the useful stuff accessible naturally (alignment, font stuff, line spacing that does what it should, “make a list,” and a sensible dropdown for font styles), while Word has *way* too much stuff on its toolbars and even with the “Home” ribbon is still divided into “function” at the top level rather than “frequently used.” \n\nMore:\n\nPages has much more sensible and intuitive header/footer behavior with “Insert Page Number” right there when you click into it, and four good display options.\n\nWords default heading levels look like trash, Pages don’t.\n\nPages treats fonts with respect, kerns them right, and uses ligatures properly. Word tortures fonts by default, and doesn’t even do right by its defaults. Even though I’ve managed to dig down and find the “turn ligatures on” setting in word, it didn’t work.\n\nPages does what I want with inserted images ~90% of the time, Word basically never.\n\nI’d say something about having gotten Table of Contents working in Pages but never Word, but truthfully if I need any level of internal reference I don’t just need chapter, section, and sub-section, I need “figure” and “table” and I’m going to use LaTeX. \n\nI just cannot conceive of using Word’s “professional” features, and I’ve yet to meet anyone who voluntarily does. If I want something that makes basic words in space/on a page look good out of the box, Pages does great. If I want something that gives me a great deal of granular control over my document I’m going to use software that starts with the assumption that I *want* granular control in the first place. I’d only use Word if I wanted software that made it really difficult to set how many lines is acceptable before just putting a section on a new page (2, for the record), and then ignoring what I tell it.",
