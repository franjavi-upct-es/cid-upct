This has been applied to Nazi Germany among many others -- for example, Germany had concentration camps and campaigns of genocide and slavery long before Hitler took power... it's just that this was all done to people in Africa, not Europe. The \"civilized\" nations were all perfectly comfortable with Germany enacting \"final solutions\" on people outside of Europe, but when the same thing was done within Europe it was seen as what it always was: horror and barbarism that must be crushed and never allowed to happen again.\n\nA lot of the stuff we're seeing right now under Trump is fairly routine for the US / US backed regimes... it's just that it was always done to people outside the US. And now this it's happening inside the US, we call it \"fascism\".\n\nSo while I don't think it's helpful to shrug and say the US was always fascist as it becomes more and more fascist every day, it *is* kind of true. And it *is* important to take note of this and incorporate it into our understanding, our path forward, and our actions afterwards.\n\nBecause if you want to oppose Trump but are fine with, say, throwing trans people under the bus in order to do it (the way some Democrats are trending), you are literally contributing to your own destruction. There are multitudes of people who have been fighting US fascism for longer than any of us have been alive, who understand it better than any of us and know what needs to be done to end it (they just lacked the power to do it). And the best way to end this is to listen to and empower them, and to support their liberation (and in doing so support our own).\n\nThe bad news is that US fascism is getting worse. The good news is that many people have known this for a long time and have already done a lot of the work figuring out how to oppose it. So rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, we need to listen to and empower those who already did so.",

While Apple has already been carbon neutral on the global corporate level, the company wants to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle.\n\n\"We're incredibly proud of the progress we're making toward Apple 2030, which touches every part of our business,\" Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives said.",

Also, the fan sounded like a jet engine even when idle. \n\n3 years later, I did a 180 on my feelings about Macbooks, when that piece of shit finally kicked the bucket and my employer issued me a 16\" M1 Pro as a replacement.

It's actually related to a 40 year old California law that precedes many similar modern right-to-repair laws.\n\nCalifornia requires manufacturers of electronics or appliances with a wholesale price to a retailer greater than $100 to make parts and repair literature available for service and repair for a minimum of seven years after last manufacture regardless of warranty period. After 7 years, they are not obligated by law to provide parts or service, so it becomes \"obsolete\". It is just a term to indicate no law requires them to provide support for the thing you bought.\n\nThe \"vintage\" distinction comes from the fact that there were no uniform laws in the US (or globally at the time the distinction was made) regarding the requirement of parts/service availability. 5 years is the count down for parts availability; if your region/locality doesn't require parts or service beyond 5 years (EU minimum, though that now also differs on the type of product, as phones are treated differently from laptops), Apple is under no obligation to provide support.",
